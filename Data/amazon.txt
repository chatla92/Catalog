A. Freeman:::We got this GPS for my husband who is an (OTR) over the road trucker.  Very Impressed with the shipping time, it arrived a few days earlier than expected...  within a week of use however it started freezing up... could of just been a glitch in that unit.  Worked great when it worked!  Will work great for the normal person as well but does have the "trucker" option. (the big truck routes - tells you when a scale is coming up ect...)  Love the bigger screen, the ease of use, the ease of putting addresses into memory.  Nothing really bad to say about the unit with the exception of it freezing which is probably one in a million and that's just my luck.  I contacted the seller and within minutes of my email I received a email back with instructions for an exchange! VERY impressed all the way around!<<<I'm a professional OTR truck driver, and I bought a TND 700 at a truck stop hoping to make my life easier.  Rand McNally, are you listening?First thing I did after charging it was connect it to my laptop and install the software and then attempt to update it.  The software detected a problem with my update and wanted my home address so I could be sent a patch on an SD card.  Hello?  I don't think I'm all that unusual; my home address is a PO box that a friend checks weekly and that I might get to check every six months or so.  I live in my truck and at truck stops.  If you need to make a patch available on an SD card then you should send the SD cards to the truck stops where the devices are sold.  I ran the update program multiple times until the program said that the TND 700 was completely updated.I programmed in the height (13'6"), the length (53') and the weight (80,000#) of my rig and told it that I preferred highways.  I was parked at a truck stop in the Cincinnati OH area.  My next pickup was about 15 miles down the same freeway but on the other side of it a couple of blocks.  My cell phone GPS (Sprint) said to get on the freeway to get to my pickup.  The TND 700 routed me thru 23 miles of residential streets before finally getting me to my pickup.  Very exciting, especially since every time I refused to turn down a street posted "No Trucks" the TND 700 took almost 5 minutes to figure a re-route, and it happened multiple times on that short trip.I decided to give it another chance.  After my pickup on the north side of Cincinnati just off of I-75 I needed to head to Phoenix AZ via I-71.  Easy route is to just hop on I-75 and drive west and south to the intersection of I-71.  Indeed, that is what my cell phone advised.  The TND 700, however, wanted to route me over surface streets across the city and pick up I-75 on the other side of the city.  I turned it off and the next time I passed a truck stop of the same chain I purchased it at I returned it and got my money back.I then spent $30 on a cheap printer.  Now I take a minute to set up my route on Google and print it out.  Hasn't gotten me lost yet over several cross country trips.<<<Well, what can I say.  I've had this unit in my truck for about four days now.  Prior to that I had a Garmin 755T non-truck GPS.  One of my favorite features in that unit was the ability to plan a route by determining mileage using the stop or via feature.  What I would do is using a map I would route myself several different ways forcing the unit by putting in stops or vias at different locations along the route, otherwise, like most GPS 's, it determines what it thinks is the best route.  I could add up to 10 Via's or stop points for each route and then based on mileage and other factors determine which is the best route to take.  Multiple stops and the ability to route was the most important reason for having the Garmin.  However it was not truck specific.  And considering I am now hauling strictly hazmat I wanted something that would take that into consideration.  After perusing various forums, review sites, and word-of-mouth my choices boiled down to the Garmin 465T or the RAND McNally Intelliroute TND 700.  Even though it was quite a bit more than the Garmin I chose the TND 700 for several reasons.  The main one being the extra screen size, and its ability to coordinate with the RAND McNally truck atlas and also its ease of updating.Now on to my first impression of the TND 700.  It seems to be an aesthetically pleasing and durably built unit.  The first thing I noticed was it's very slow to boot compared to my old Garmin.  Whether this is unique to the TND 700 or is common amongst all truck specific gps units I cannot tell, but it's really not that big of a deal.  The second thing I noticed was the overwhelming wealth of information put forth.  That might explain why the manual (available via the TND dock) is well over 100 pages long.....  There is somewhat of a learning curve with this unit.  The next thing I noticed was the complexity of entering routes.  As previously mentioned I like to force it into my preferred routing by the use of stops or vias.  That was a big no go with this unit.  While you can enter multiple stops or vias it is nowhere near as user-friendly as my old Garmin.  Furthermore there is no way you can determine total mileage on the route that you have chosen, as I could with the Garmin.  Totally flummoxed by what appeared to be an omission of one of the best routing tools a trucker could have I went online and verified through an expert source connected with RAND McNally that no, that feature was a couple updates down the line and was not available at this point.  Unbelievable.  Also forcing the unit to follow a specific route can be very challenging.  For a unit of this price, and feature laden, I find this totally unacceptable.  I am still mulling over selling this unit  and buying the Garmin 465T.  I really do like this GPS, the screen is magnificent, and the volume is awesome.Another thing I've noticed, which I do not think is unique to this unit, is some of the weird routing that it does.  I've never owned a truck specific GPS before but after playing with this one for a couple of days I get the impression that what RAND MacNally (and the others that use Navteq) has done is take a plain old car specific Navteq map and a road atlas with truck restrictions and made notifications on the map.  In most databases there is not a 100% thorough listing of every road in the country.  What I mean is that this unit will route you down roads you don't belong on.  Today while coming home it tried routing me on several  9 ton County roads.  What that means is that a truck is limited to 73280 unless the road is posted at 10 tons.  County roads do not have that restriction listed in the RAND McNally road atlas, so I believe that is why it is not listed.....  Also unacceptable in a unit of this price and sold as truck specific.  However I'd be willing to bet the other truck specific units are the same way as no one has ever done a truck specific version of NavTeq.Another bone I have to pick is the POI's. Not only the truck specific ones but the others all seem to be somewhat outdated.  I think the Garmin, at least the ones that I have used, are more current.  It would also be nice if I could add my own POI'sTo sum it up I will keep this unit a little longer to see if I can make it workable.  If not I will go back to Garmin.  I like the concept and I like the unit but at this point I'll have to say I am somewhat unimpressed.pros:Large screenterrific imagesoutstanding volumecons:inability to determine route mileage by multiple stops and viasa somewhat outdated POI information.Non-truck specific routings.Cost.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/0528881469

The piece that attaches to the wall isn't overly long, which made it easier to mount the arm in the tight space I needed to mount it in.

But yes, I would highly recommend it.<<<I love nooks.

Dgl":::Highly disappointed. I purchased the new B/W touch version of the Nook and had intended to use it for lecturing in class when I need to do it from the book. I didn't know that you couldn't download the etextbooks to my Nook from the NookStudy part of Barnes and Nobles. Why would you call this NookStudy if you can't download the textbooks to a Nook reader?Seriously!I could live with the some of the shortfalls for this device (slow touch response, flickering on the screen when changing pages, keyboard mistypes characters, etc), but not being able to download a textbook from something that says "Nook"Study? Smacks of misrepresentation, somebody should sue. On the NookStudy web page, it says that a "Nook" is not required, it should say, "Not intended for Nook Devices". Also, it will not load onto any other hand-held device that has the Nook app, only on a PC or a Mac. They should rename it to "DeskTop Study", using the Nook label when you can't use it on a Nook device is false advertising (anybody want to sue?).Anyway, I'm returning this and buying a Kindle (at least Amazon will tell you what devices you can install their etextbooks, i.e. almost all their Kindles, Mac, PC and oh, an iPad!).If your planning on buying this for your college bound student, get them a Kindle instead.<<<This nook has a very nice format and is very easy to operate and view.  The only draw back is the Battery life is terrible.  I am charging this unit twice a day.  My former Simple Touch only needed charging once a month &#34;with the wifi ON&#34; all the time.  I would NOT recommend this product.<<<If anyone have used previous version of nook you will immediately see the improvements on new version of nook. One of the most important feature I found on the new nook was better page turn response. The screen refresh when moving from page to page is much quicker, nearly matching the refresh rates of the latest Kindle. The Nook also added a laundry list of interface and usability improvements, such as the ability to organize your book collection by category which is called "shelves".I liked 600 X 800 display screen. It comes with 16 shades of gray and is easy to your eyes. I can read all day without hurting my eyes. My personal opinion, i would love this device more if I could read it at night without lights.ProsLibrary with thousands of books, magazine that comes free, built-in free wireless data network, plus Wi-Fi connectivity (no PC needed); separate capacitive color touch-screen pad for navigation, and a virtual keyboard for notes and annotations; 2GB of internal memory (capable of storing 1,500 electronic books) as well as a microSD expansion slot for additional memory; font style and size are adjustable; displays image files and plays MP3 music files; compatible with Windows and Mac machines; battery is removable and user-replaceable; allows free browsing of full-text books while within Barnes & Noble stores; you can lend certain e-books for up to 14 days free of charge; EPUB format compatibility lets you read free Google Books and loaner e-books from your local library; page turn speeds are faster with firmware upgrade.The bad: No protective carrying case included; color LCD ( for color nook)  has an impact on battery life; for black & white battery is really good,in-store reading and loaning capabilities come with notable limits and caveats; no support for Word or text files; no ability to download books when outside the U.S., even when on Wi-Fi.Does it beat Kindle?According to design my answer is no.  The third-generation Amazon Kindle is lighter, thinner, and simply feels a little better to hold in your hand. It also offers double the battery life, more internal memory (4GB versus 2GB). But the new upgrades has given some new features to nook that are not available in kindle. Nook should definitely remain under consideration when you're shopping for e-ink e-book readers. The decision may come down to a personal preference, such as how you feel about the color navigation screen versus the hard keyboard found on the Kindle.If my review did not answer any questions, leave a comment below and I will try my best to answer your question.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/1400532620

But I got the Nook to try out the ebook loan facilities from libraries. The layout and user interface is not as user friendly as the kindle, as on the kindle, pressing the home button brings us back to the library. On the Nook, the home button opens a menu, then you need to select the options. Also, if you sort the books by &#34;Recent&#34; it does not show the most recently read books in order, but still displays books in order of &#34;recently downloaded&#34;, not a useful function.But on a positive note, the Nook combines the touch facilities and button control (to turn the pages) of both the Kindle Touch & normal kindle. The borrowing of ebook a from public libraries is done on your PC, then imported onto the Nook via Adobe Digital Editions. A bit of a hassle, but a good option which Kindles do not offer. Overall, it's a good companion to Kindle, especially if you wish to borrow library books.<<<I need to buy a gift for my mother's birthday and I know she likes to read books while on break at her job. I thought the Nook would be a great gift for her, after reading reviews here on Amazon that it can download and read free ebooks from library sites. Our local library offers ebooks so I thought it would be great.After getting the Nook, I learned a number of things:1. The Nook does NOT have a browser. It can only connect to the Barnes and Noble online bookstore.2. You are REQUIRED to have a valid credit card, even to download free content.3. While there is a way to root (hack) the Nook and thus enable a functional browser, it voids the warranty and is way too complicated to follow. I shouldn't have to hack a device to enable such a basic functionality.My mother isn't very computer savvy, and doesn't own a credit card, so I couldn't give her something like this. If it let you connect to library sites and download library books for free, it would be an ideal ereader. In it's current form, it's an overly-complicated money sinkhole. Now I'm out $70 and I still need to buy my mother a birthday present.I don't know why some of these other reviewers claim it can be used to download library ebooks. Claiming that a device has a functionality that it in fact does not have, is a really despicable thing to do.If you don't mind a wireless device owning a copy of your credit card, and throwing money at it to read books, then the Barnes & Noble Nook is right for you. If you are looking for an easy to use Ereader for library ebooks, STAY AWAY!<<<I loved my Nook very much, Its very comfortable to use . What I  love about Nook more than kindle , that I could pick any Russian book, magazine  on Internet download on my computer , convert to PD format and download on Nook + I could pick on Nook any size of letters for comfortable reading .. On Kindle you can make bigger size of letters only if you Bought ebook on Kindle store. Other PD format books have so small size of letters , only if you zoom text , which I find uncomfortable  Like I said with Nook no problem.

As long as you understand that it doesn't have a camera, its powerful and inexpensive. It even comes with Google Play! East your hear out Kindle users!Up for your own project? Head over to the XDA developer forums and find out how to load a clean version of Android either right on the device or run it off a microSD card.Great screen, fast processor. This thing still has enough power to run the latest apps and Android OS!<<<Well, I bought it because of the 1080p resolution.  The screen quality is beautiful.  I already have an Apple 4th generation iPad, but I couldn't resist on the high quality picture and low price.  After I received the Nook, I immediately rooted with Kit Kat, the latest operating system.  Let me tell you, I am glad that I made the move.  The original Ice Cream Sandwich OS has lag but not Kit Kat.  With Kit Kat, not only the Nook operates much more smoothly, you also get the full Android tablet experience and more apps available from Google Play.I recently stumbled across the XBMC Cine Player Android app in the Google Play store.  With this app, I can now stream over 1500 movies in HD quality for free.  I have been using XBMC for a little while now on both MacBook Pro and Raspberry Pi, though the Cine Player version's library is not as extensive as the MacBook Pro and Raspberry Pi, it is good enough for use when you are on the road like in a hotel or something.  With Kit Kat, I experience very little buffering issue. I can also output contents to a TV via the Nook HDMI adapter.  I believe you can output signal to a TV via Google Chromecast but I haven't tried it yet so I can't be for sure.I highly recommend the Nook if you root it with the latest OS.  I am finding more and more things that I can do with the Nook then the iPad due to Android is an open system.By the way, I use N2A to root my two Nook HD+'s.  With a N2A micro SD card, it gives you the dual boot capabilities.  You can use it to boot Kit Kat or the native Barnes and Noble OS without removing the card.  The N2A card doesn't replace the native OS as the Kit Kat OS is stored in the micro SD card so you don't have to be concerned about voiding the warranty from alternating the tablet OS.Bottom line, the Nook HD+ is already a pretty decent tablet.  One can greatly improve its potential with a simple change to the OS.  If front and back cameras and GPS are not necessities for you, the Nook is a good value tablet for 1/3 of the cost of an iPad.  By the way, I bought an external bluetooth GPS for $16 and it works like a charm with the Nook.  One can expect to spend $100 for an external bluetooth GPS if your IOS device doesn't come with an internal GPS.<<<My husband had one and I got this one for Christmas.

Bordage "Joe":::Awesome replacement for an ipod video 5th gen 30gb hard drive, saved me the cost of buying a brand new iPod.<<<THIS ARTICLE WITH ALL MY EXPECTATIONS FULFILLED RECOMMEND IT BECAUSE THE PACKAGING AND JURISDICTION ENTRAG CORRECT, IN ADDITION TO RUN FERFECION<<<A very easy replacement for a 5th gen ipod 30G HD.  I purchased the ipod on ebay knowing it was damaged.  It had the "sad ipod face" screen of death.  I could hear the HD trying to spin up, but not reading properly.  If you have that indication, all you need is this HD!The repair was easy.  Carefully pry apart the ipod with a small flat screwdriver and remove the smaller connector.  The ipod can now be placed on a table with both pieces open.  Next, remove the bad HD by unplugging the ribbon cable ON THE HD SIDE.  Make sure to note the orientation of the HD as it will only work one way...easy to put the replacement HD in "backwards".  Replace with the new HD.  The only trouble I had was the cable would not stay in the HD for some reason.  I had to use a piece of tape to secure the cable to the HD so it wouldn't come out.  Next, using a small pair of needle-nose pliers, grip the small ribbon cable gently, and push it back into it's slot.  Finally, carefully hold the HD in place and re-attach the two ipod pieces.Now you will have to restore to factory settings.  There are resources on the net for this...I just started up iTunes and plugged in the ipod.  After a few min. iTunes reconized that the ipod needed to be restored.Good luck!:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/3930992868

Since I don't have Skype, there is no way of knowing if it would work with Skype or compatible with it.<<<We were very happy with this purchase at first, but some of the buttons have stopped working after using it a few times a week for a couple months.  The volume buttons no longer work and the volume can't be adjusted on the laptop, so we have to suffer through a blasting speaker in order to gain the benefits of the microphone, which also seems as if it may be starting to have intermittent problems.<<<This film is definitely not for anyone who is especially fond of the independent, delightfully manipulative and clever boy who was the brain child of Samuel Clemens's classic.As one example, the book has great  fun with the scenes involving Aunt Polly, a simple minded soul who thinks  herself quite clever, and the genuinely shrewd Tom, who plays on catering  to Polly's illusions about her own wit. This is a far cry from beautiful,  intelligent Celeste Holm's portrayal of Polly - and the family's poverty,  clearly seen in the book, disappears, as the Sawyers occupy a beautiful  home and are close friends with wealthy Widow Douglas.Some of the plot  is distorted in ways that remove the charm of the original. Tom's taking  off to &quot;play pirates&quot; after Becky jilts him is changed into a  troubled kid's escape after Aunt Polly tells him how &quot;no good&quot;  his father was - the humour, and the engaging portrayal of adolescent  &quot;first love&quot; is gone. The theme of Tom's learning responsibility  is overworked, and sequences that are hilarious in the book (Sunday school,  classroom, etc) are largely left out. The enchanting Becky Thatcher is  reduced to a tomboy. And isn't much of the picnic sequence ruined when a  gathering of kids is changed to a song-and-dance outing for families? (Tom  Sawyer is quite realistic in its setting forth that kids are far more  concerned with themselves than fretting about parents - let's not turn it  into a commentary on &quot;family values&quot; a la 1990s political  correctness.)Johnny Whitaker's singing voice has all the appeal of  chalk squeaking on a blackboard. His rendition of &quot;If I Were God&quot;  (aside from its text having nothing to do with the story - Tom's only  church interests are in time to play with his pinch bug) is pure purgatory  for the listener.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/3936710058

Wow,,,,what a great movie!I've seen many versions of &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; but this one seems to be the best ever brought to the screen.  Maybe because it's a musical. Whatever made this so successful back then you will not be disappointed by it's gradure and scope. A must for ever American kid and adult too. This is as red, white and blue as it gets and now must be the most politically incorrect movie ever made. (hehe)  Buy it before some group puts a ban on it.

It does not follow the book exactly, but the substance is there. Charming performances by then child actors Johnny Whitaker (Tom) and Jodie Foster (Becky Thatcher) and Academy-Award-winner Celeste Holm as Aunt Polly. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I rented it for my granddaughter's school project and wound up watching it 3 times. It took me back to my childhood of playing with the children next door in a more neighborly world.Highly recommended.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/6301977173

After that it work as described. Delivery was fast.<<<I got this because it was pretty decently priced, honestly though seeing how some of the other video capture devices out there were upwards of $60 I wasn't expecting much.  When I got, I was rather surprised how well it worked.  While it's plug 'n play, I decided to forgo the install CD and just downloaded the drivers directly from the manufacturer's website.  While the video is decent quality, it still retains some grainyness after burning the video to a DVD, the quality of the original played on a VCR is still better quality than what you capture and burn to a DVD.  That being said, it's not all that bad, really.  But since I only needed to copy a few home videos that we made from an old VHS-C camcorder it wasn't really worth it.I found that the best way to get the best quality was to adjust the video settings manually (add a little more saturation, and sharpness), and use the "DVD" format for capture, that were there is minimal second encoding required when you burn to a disc (I use windows DVD maker, because I'm cheap :B)The nice thing is it also includes an S-video option, unfortunately my VCR only allows S-video with 480p signals (ie DVD movies and restricts VCR video to 480i.  The DVD capture format seems to add some deinterlacing to the captured video from what I can tell (though it might just be my video card doing it)  Still, it's a pretty good buy for someone who wants to archive or even send family members burned DVDs of videos.<<<A little background...I am a 38 year old man who has played around with electronics and computers my entire life.

Moleskine Folio Digital Tablet Cover for Apple iPad:::8862936826:::Office & School Supplies:::From Moleskine, the legendary manufacturer of books-yet-to-be written, comes the newest analog-digital hybrid tool: the Moleskine tablet cover. Designed to accommodate the Apple iPad, the features and style of this cover are classic Moleskine: sleek rounded corners, strong elastic band, and the iconic smooth black cover. The cover protects and cushions the device, in a silhouette that's instantly classic and contemporary. It's a simple design beloved by writers, artists, and readers for over a century.				    						:::https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61L5HRjIGaL._SX200_.jpg:::J. Haggard>>>Jongbok Yi>>>Richard Davis "Computer & Gadget Geek":::I'm starting my review over and changing this from 4 stars (I like it) to 2 stars (I don't like it).. At first I praised it highly based upon initial expectations., but now that I actually used it for work I'm seeing it may not be the case for me.I've tried a number of cases for the ipad from a travel case to the marware eco-vue to the otterbox. I always wanted one with a notepad built in and was excited to see the Moleskine iPad case. I placed my order on Nov. 7th and after nearly 3 weeks it finally arrived.Initial reactions, I like the case. It was thick and felt pretty solid. I liked the way the case held the iPad and overall the case seemed really well built. Now, I don't have ANY issues with the build quality. The case is built very well. And others have complained about the thickness, well I expected it to be a little thick since it now has a notebook with it. My measurement, it's just at the 1" mark in terms of thickness.What did I like:-Construction quality, very nicely made.-iPad protection, the iPad is held very securely in the case, big plus.-Love that it has a notebook, unfortunately it's not a standard size which makes this a minus as well.-Looks professional. This is one of the best looking cases I have seen.My issue comes into the issues I found while using the case.First off, the volume and mute switch are on the inside of the case. This means you need to fold open the case if you need to mute or turn the sound down on your ipad. It's a minor inconvenience, but if I'm in a meeting and my calendar app starts shooting alerts it's nice to be able to flip the switch quickly then go through opening the notebook up and having to mute it. Now in most meetings I am actively taking notes but in other meetings I'm just a observer so when I am not taking notes this issue causes more of a distraction.Second, replacement notebooks. I have been searching high and low for replacement notebooks and cannot find any. I found some small jr. legal pads and tried those and yes they work, but they don't sit as securely in the sleeve like the moleskine brand pad is and I think this could cause to ripping or sagging of the fabric. I think you are going to need moleskine brand pads or risk ruining the fabric sleeve. This is just a guess. And since you can't at the current time buy replacement notebooks you are out of luck once you run through the initial 50 pages.Third, no pen loop. They give you a notebook and a spot for your iPad, but nowhere to hook a pen. Yes I can carry a pen in my pocket, but you would think for the cost there would be a small loop to hold a pen or iPad Stylus like the pogosketch.Fourth, the true left-handedness of the case. The case can in fact be used by left handed people, but that causes a few issues. First off the back becomes the cover and now you have an upside down moleskine logo, plus the band is attached to the back so the sleek look is gone. Then my biggest complaint, the iPad is upside down when used in left handed mode so the home button is at the top. This also means the microphone is opposite the home button. So when the home button is at the top the microphone is pointed towards you. I use an app to record audio from meetings and take notes and when the iPad is faced the right direction this works flawlessly. When I use the Moleskine case in left handed mode the microphone faces me and in turn the audio is hard to hear as it is pointed away from the conversations.Fifth, no stand. It would be nice if you could somehow stand the ipad up but this case is really just meant to be used flat on it's back. It's not sold as a case with a stand, but come on, for topping the $60 mark you would think it would have one.All in all, it's  nice to finally have a case, built well with a notepad. But given the lack of replacement notebooks readily for sale for this case and no pen loop to carry a writing instrument makes it weak. I can use the case in right handed mode, but they sell it as left handed compatible and it really isn't as functional as it should be. They instead should release a second model that IS built for left handed and not make one unit semi-reversible.I may end up returning this case and going back to my marware. I'm going to keep using it until the end of this week before deciding..--UPDATE 12/9/2010--I have returned the case back to Amazon and have gone back to theMarware Eco-Vue for iPad. This out of all the cases I have use is the best for my personal situation. I wanted to like the Moleskine case but it just didn't work for me and I still can't find replacement notepads. Sorry Moleskine, perhaps revision 2 will be the one for me, but so far your case didn't meet my expectations.<<<I have read many reviews on folio cases for iPad. You will find "the best ever" in most of reviews that have got over four stars. So, I won't say the cliche, but want to say that I am very satisfied. Although I love my iPad, I'd felt sad as a fountain pen collector that my fountain pens are no longer useful. Then, I bumped into this case. What a wonderful idea to put Moleskine with iPad!Someone said in the previous review that it is a inch thick, and it is true. I feel like I am holding a book. However, it makes me feel that my iPad is well protected. The quality of paper is good as always, and it is very easy to flip over. Also, it also has the rubber band! Since I don't have keen eyes to see whether it is real leather or not, but the skin feels smooth and soft.<<<This product appeared to be high quality and well made.  It also has the feature that turns on the iPad when the cover is opened.The Moleskin does have a very nice, luxurious feel.For me, it was just too heavy.  Not in pounds, but when you hold an iPad up for a few hours, a few ounces can make a big difference.There is another iPad cover sold on Amazon that is a big seller, at around $20+, made of a synthetic material.  It is much lighter, and also turns on when opened.I hate to pass on higher quality and probably longer lasting, but this Moleskin cover was just too tiring for me.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/8862936826

I didnt want to get one at a time to compare so I just bought both. My mini mic cost me $.34 and just under $4 shipping and rapcap was $14.50 and free shipping.I compared both for sound quality and distance at which they pick up sound. Turns out the only difference is the rapcap is white plastic spray painted pretty while the mini mic is either white or black plastic. Also the Rapcap is about .5mm smaller in diameter but same size in length. The caps construction is identical. Both work identical. Everything is the same. The only thing to test is durability but I'm confident it will be the same.So save the money and buy this one over the RapCap. They pick up sound great from a distance if you have it about 10 feet away from an instructor so just plug it in and stand it up near the instructors desk or sit near where he or she talks and youll be fine. I have a flip open case so I can plug mine in and stand it up so ill pick up sound great.Only complaint I have is that I bought the Rapcap too.<<<When I wanted to use my iPod to record some reminders to myself I looked around for a compatible microphone expecting to pay $25 to $50 or more and having a twenty page instruction book to study, but then I found this little gem at a great price and no instruction book to study and it works like a charm for me, just plug it in and go.

This adapter will NOT step-up or step-down voltage (unnecessary with modern electronics).The only possible improvements to this would be if there was an extra USB port or if it was somehow rotatable.This thing kicks ASS and is a great bargain compared to the other name-brand junk out there that is either over-priced or over-priced AND doesn't have USB power.<<<These are great, the USB port is especially handy. Small size, and all the adapters I could want. At first it seemed to light to do it's job but it is working great. It is the only adapter that I use when travelling.<<<This is very handy and it charges two things at once easily. I usually charge my laptop and iPod touch in this at the same time and have not had problems with it so far. It also has all of its individual parts for the various plugs it is capable of fitting in all contained within itself, which is very handy because you don't have to remember where you put the EU plug or the US plug, etc!:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/9888002198

Meredith>>>intanet>>>J.F. Carroll "the man from san dusky":::For some reason couldn't find high bias cassette tapes around town. Amazon to the rescue. No problems or complaints with this product.<<<THIS PRODUCT IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE AT J AND R.  YOU ENTER  YOUR INFORMATION AND THEN GET TO THE PLACE WHERE IT SAYS: "PLACE YOUR ORDER" AND THE CART GOES TO "0".  REAL DRAG.  i CALLED JANDR TWICE ABOUT REMOVING THIS PAGE FROM AMAZON BUT THEY SAID IT TAKES TIME.<<<let's just get past all the bs, okay? they--as in maxell--should still be selling these. I record on them all the time and it's just so fng ridiculous that they could be discontinued, or be sold for fifty dollars. It's true, that no tape really sounds better than these, unless they were to start releasing metal tapes again, which is impossible in this market.I record lps onto these tapes, and listen to them in the car. It took me a long time to get the peaks right for recording, as in where I should average the peak decibels to record at. I eventually came to five plus, which means the bars never go above four decibels. I believe my peak levels are in line with the balance of sound, that while the directional booklet for my cassette player (a tck670 sony three-head) says record at plus three, letting it go a little bit above that but average at +3, means you're getting as much sound  without breaking your eardrums. They also say to record two decibels below the distortion point, and for me that's like 7+ on a lot of stuff[some records are louder or softer than others when it comes to decibels. For instance Prince sign O' the Times is very loud, and I record at around five+ or below, while the smiths queen is dead, the newly remastered version, is softer, and I record at a 7 recording level. Recording level is how much sound is filtered through the cassette player onto the recording medium, while the decibel count meter shows you how--scientifically that is--loud what you are recording really is].Now I'm not gonna' say it's always pretty, sometimes there's an album like let it bleed, where the lp was put together rather shoddily, and the acoustic tracks are subzero to the rockier tracks. In such cases I've tried to record each track at the peak individually, though I haven't really heard them enough yet to know if this works. I will say that listening to these on a car stereo, well, the car stereo is a lot more sensitive than floor-standers and a good sony receiver. You have to be accurate to get the best sounding tape, but the reward can be fantastic.You see, I used to listen to cds, like all through college, but then my ears started to turn negative to the extreme highs and mids. Plus, you never understand the music in your brain from a cd like you do on an lp. Basically I cannot barely stand to listen to digital unless I have extremely good speakers, and that's not often.So lps it is for me, but I wanted to hear them in my car, so began this whole trek to get the tapes to sound right. High bias is much more difficult to get right than normal bias, which if you listen through a good stereo, reveals all the definition of a rough sketch on paper. The high bias is pretty accurate, though someday I would wish to maybe improve the class of cassette player I have and see if I can't do even better? Oh well, right now I have a system and it works pretty well.And to think they're not putting cassette players into new cars anymore! I rather think the record industry would not be suffering now as it is, if it had kept true to fidelity and analogue, and most importantly vinyl, which cannot hardly be digitally downloaded without gutting the sound and a lot of work! It's what they get for years of $20 for new cds and the nightmare of sam goody. They wanted to profit by everyone buying their collections all over again, and look where it has got them! People listen to music--if at all--as a casual thing, where they never really listen and wouldn't spend a dime for the crap they do in fact hear. The labels killed their own business by choosing the cd over the lp.But at least I can find used lps for bargain prices now, eh?Or prohibitively expensive boxsets. )::::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000001OL6

Sound quality is surprisingly good, the basic volume could be a bit higher but otherwiese it produces a clear and rich sound. The only little annoyance is, that now a cable is sticking out of the cassette deck and hangs around the front panel. But eventually I will fix it somewhere, where it is not in the way anymore.<<<The cassette, as other have said, makes a clicking noise as it runs.  I have it in a 2001 Rav4 OEM stereo.

I've been using this cassette adapter for the past two years. The sound quality is good, although you can hear some typical cassette noise at higher volumes. The cassette adapter itself is fairly quiet as well. In cold weather, it sometimes sticks a bit. But overall, it has worked quite well. I don't leave my mp3 player in the car, so the stereo cable saw quite a bit of abuse from daily bouts of plugging and unplugging.

In the process of shopping for a new player, I came across information on CD lens cleaners. People were saying that they saved their CD player. Well, it's true! Don't believe internet information that tells you that eventually the lasers give out! My 12 year-old CD player just had a dirty lens, it wasn't broken.This one has little brushes on the underside that clean off your laser lens. Some reviews indicated that this was the only one they tried that the CD player accepted, so that was the reason I picked this one.You put the CD in the player, in my case a 5 CD changer, and hit play. It then plays a little music and talks to you! When it's done cleaning your CD player lens it tells you and lets you continue for a sound system check - basically makes sure your speakers are hooked to the right channels.

As I said, these headphones are not intended for audiophiles. That said, distortion isn't a problem even with the audio cranked up.These headphones don't pretend to be noise-cancelling. They are just nice average headphones with adequate audio response and the added benefit of folding into a manageably small form factor.

Expoimaging Expodisc Filter Pro Digital Neutral White Balance in 82mm - Expoimaging Expodisc:::B000006OQ8:::Camera & Photo:::Get accurate color in difficult lighting with the patented ExpoDisc, the fast and easy digital white balance filter.Simply read and set white balance with the ExpoDisc in place before shooting and you&rsquo;ll reduce or eliminate the need for post-capture color adjustments.Get the white balance solution that is quickly becoming the preferred method of achieving accurate color balance for professional photographers today.Here is how it works:Varying levels of colorcast typically occur in digital photography and require compensation as part of the process to create a photograph with good color fidelity. Until now, photographers have had to rely on gray/white cards to solve this problem. The ExpoDisc is an easy to use custom white balance solution that eliminates the inconvenience and inconsistencies of other methods. It is a neutral diffusion filter that gathers ambient light and passively transmits 18% of it through to your camera&rsquo;s light meter, effectively producing a &lsquo;gray frame&rsquo;.You then set a custom white balance using the &lsquo;gray frame&rsquo; that results in accurate color in most lighting conditions.Your camera essentially compensates for and neutralizes the colorcast it sees through the ExpoDisc.				    						:::https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61GkS0PmcFL._SX200_.jpg:::James Pierce>>>minkylina "cheesypouf76">>>Randall Stewart:::Title says it all. This product is so simple and easy to use that even novice photographers should buy this.<<<I heard others rave about the Expodisc for some time.  I thought the cost was a little high, especially since there are many other less expensive ways to set white balance (in camera settings, grey card, coffee filters...don't laugh, I did this and it was actually the next best thing to the Expodisc).  Well, I bought my Expodisc and I am a convert to the church of Expodisc.  This thing is awesome.  It gets me perfect WB every time, whether I'm using natural light, bounced flash, strobes, or a combination of all different kinds of light.  I have never once had to change the WB in post and my photos look awesome SOOC.  You can also use the Expodisc as an incedent light meter, which is pretty awesome.  I would totally buy it again.<<<I bought the current Expodisc to replace an earlier model recently stolen. The old model seemed overpriced, but it was hand-made in a low volume production. Current models made by new owners are priced about 170% more than the old, for which you get a fancy box and a few instructions on a CD rather than on a peice of paper - big deal. However, the new models have a lens mounting arrangement which is much superior to the prior model and much more expensive to make. As to function, nothing really replaces an Expodisc if you need one for white balancing a color photo exposure. I use mine to shoot "grey" color negatives to automate traditional color printing. I have no experience as to whether they provide superior white balancing in digital systems as claimed, but logically they should do so. Unless you plan to be very exacting about color reproduction in your color printing, the excessive cost of an Expodisc versus the marginal benefit seems questionable. If you Photoshop your pictures to death, you will get no value from this item.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000006OQ8

Basically, in a quiet environment these sound pretty good.  They aren't as good as similarly-priced studio-class headsets, but you're paying for the noise cancelling.  The raw capability is pretty decent, and has acceptable detail in treble, vocal, and bass ranges.The noise cancelling works pretty well.  I've taken these on several intercontinental flights and they do a decent job of blocking out engine rumble and screaming kids.  They also do a decent job of blocking out adult human voices, which is nice in the office.However, I must have pretty big ears, and I've found that the foam cups aren't quite thick enough to adequately push the driver away from my outer ear.  After 2 or 3 hours of use my ears start to ache a bit.The cord is plenty long, and can be disconnected in the middle to link to an optional Sony wired remote control.  An adapter to convert the standard 1/8th inch stereo jack to the dual 1/8th inch jacks in many airplane seats is included.The thing that I don't like about this is that I find these uncomfortable when I try to lean my head against the window in an airplane and sleep.  I think that the MDR-NC11's might have been a better choice in that regard.They're also kind of bulky unless you have a large carry-on to keep them in.  I'm paranoid about putting these in the seat pocket in front of me, since the MDR-NC20's come with a soft bag instead of a rigid clamshell like the Bose headsets.  I haven't had any spills yet, but active travellers may wish to find a case that's more rigid.All in all, I'm pretty happy with these.  The natural audio sound and the noise cancelling are plenty sufficient for the price... I couldn't justify the $300 for Bose unless I needed the protective clamshell and had ears that fit perfectly into their earcups.<<<I will admit that I recently gave up my Sony Headphones for the Bang and Olufsen A8's ----- however, that was more for portabilities sake, than soundwith regards to sound, this is the BEST pair of headphones that I have usedThe noise cancelling features are excellent! -- putting these things on, along with the noise cancellers, allows you to hear sounds that you never knew existed within many of your favorite songsI compared these headphones, head to head, on an airplane, against the Bose Quiet Comfort 2, and there was no difference in sound - both performed excellently, and equally, within the airplane environment ---- however, the Sony ones were more comfortable and MUCH cheaperDon't even waster your time with the Bose Quite Comfort ---- grab a pair of these and you'll fall in love quick!<<<I bought these thinking they were the ticket to noise-free, pleasant air travel.  They fall short for two reasons.  The first is that they just don't cancel that much noise.  If you're not listening to music and just compare the difference between having noise cancellation on and off, it's just not that great - partly because of the technology and partly because of the fit.  To quantify this, the noise canceling Sony headphones give 10dB of noise reduction whereas the passive David Clark H10-00 headphones for roughly the same price give 24dB just because of the better seal.  The second problem is that they generate noise of their own.  If it's not that noisy to start with they actually seem to generate a slight buzz.  So I'd recommend either getting a pair of earplugs, or a set of headphones with a better seal.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000DMA3

Wetzel>>>James W. Anderson>>>John A. Radi "jradi":::This dvd player is cheap for a reason. You get what you pay for. Most of the time this player works fine. But sometimes the picture will cut out and give you just a blue screen. You can sometimes just tap the machine and it  comes back on, other times you have to stop the movie and open the tray  just to get rid of the blue screen. Luckily this doesn't happen that often.  If you don't have a lot of money to spend on a dvd player, go for it, but  if you can spend more i would recommend something on the higher end of the  scale.<<<I've had the displeasure of owning two RCA brand DVD players and neither one made it more than a year before breaking.  I had this DVD player and a Proscan DVD/DIVX (which the salesman at [...] SWORE was the best that money could buy).  The RCA DVD just quit working entirely after 11 months (microprocesor).  My [$] Proscan DVD player now displays a "NO DISC" message seemingly at random, and for no particular reason.  Sometimes you can put a disc in and it will play the first time, others you have to try it a few times, and on the worst days you may have to try 15-20 times and it still may not work.In both cases I called RCA, sat on hold for some ridiculous amount of time, spoke to someone in technical support who knew nothing about technical support, and was ultimately told it would cost more to repair than to replace.RCA's warranty is useless, their technical support line is an exercise in futility, and I personally don't think it's worth the money to repair any of their poorly engineered products.  I've learned my lesson with RCA and will specifically avoid their products in the future.<<<Gave it to my brother - not because the first one broke!  I've had it for a year now - and not ONCE did it ever give me a problem - watch the matrix regularly.  I get rental DVD's (more scratched - usually &quot;more  difficult to play&quot;) about twice a week - and in the last 6 months of  renting so frequently I have never had a disc that gave me a problem.Overall, I think there's no reason to buy a more expensive DVD player -  like cd players, they're one and the same unless you're really descriminate  about quality or features not detectable to an average consumer.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000J05A
GE 72664 Portable AM/FM Radio, Black (Discontinued by Manufacturer):::B00000J060:::Portable Audio & Video:::w/3" speaker				    						:::https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41FH71MRB8L._SX200_.jpg:::P.J. O'Tuama>>>Randy Remote>>>Timothy B. Dereg:::I bought this for listening to NPR while working on painting and  stenciling projects on our backporch.  I was pleasantly surprised to  discover that it does a good job with music as well as spoken words.  I  also like the fact that it has a solid, metal antenna instead of one of  those thin, whispy wire ones that so interest the feline members of our  household (my husband recently bought a clock radio with one of those  antennas -- after two days it was summarily detached and removed to the  living room for the 2000 Antenna Olympics).  Another nice feature is the  little compartment in back in which you can store the electrical cord.<<<This radio might work better if you live in areas with strong radio signals. In the fringe area I live in, it doesn't work at all,whereas the little ten dollar Panasonic RF-P50 Pocket AM / FM Radio works quite well.<<<I needed a cheap radio for background music.  All I wanted was  decent sound and to receive FM radio.  I wasn't interested in playing CDs or MP3s.  Since I do a lot of work around the homestead, I wanted it to be small and easily portable and still have decent sound.  This GE radio delivers on all counts.  I live rurally but still close enough to town that I can't comment on long-distance reception.  All I can say is that I get all the radio stations that I want to listen to, the quality of the speaker is plenty good enough for my taste and level of loudness in FM music, and I don't get any frequency drift so that I don't have to constantly fiddle with the tuning knob.  It's just a great little radio for a very decent price.  The only downside is that the FM antenna is quite flimsy and can be all-too-easily bent if you knock the radio over with the antenna extended.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000J060

The ultimate Christmas present.  Great range, clear sound and when plugged in it charges the batteries.  Incredibly durable too.<<<For the price, you can't beat this sturdy radio.  Great sound, and durable.  Use it in the garage and around the deck and it's got great volumn and clarity.  You can't beat the deal that GE is providing.  Second model owned, had their original model for 13 yrs and was so impressed I got a new one.<<<Most radios you can buy have pretty cabinets, nice paint, and will sound pretty good if you're tuned to a station whose radio beams are about strong enough to cook an egg.  They're designed to impress you in the big box store, where looks and the sound of the most powerful station in town are all you have to go on.  It isn't until you get them home that you find out how miserable they are in real-world performance, trying to pick up that weak station that's the only one carrying the game you want to hear.The GE Superadio is a whole 'nother deal.It's just an AM-FM radio, aggressively avoiding any other features whatsoever.  But it's the gold standard of the type.  When a radio geek wants to say whether some other set is good on FM and, especially, AM, s/he will compare it to the Superadio.To give you an idea how good it is; I live in a semi-remote area without any really strong AM stations.  Sitting side by side on my couch, a typical 'personal stereo' type radio picks up one AM station.  A cheap transistor radio picks up three.  The Superadio picks up 37.I recommend my friends get these as part of their blackout kits.  For one thing, it will run about two hours less than forever on its six D-cells.  For another, this set can pull in AM stations at least two, three hundred miles away, in daylight, any time.  If your blackout extends farther than this radio's range, you've got more important things to worry about.Incidently, it runs off AC also.  It switches to AC automatically when you plug it in, switches back to batteries automatically if AC isn't available.Sound quality is excellent.  It's mono, but it has a good and large speaker and enough audio power to drive it properly.  It also has separate treble and bass controls.I give it four stars instead of five for three reasons:1.  Some of them don't work.  The first one I bought didn't.2.  Stations are hard for me to tune toward the upper end of the AM band.  They're packed very tightly together there, and getting from one to another nearby is fiddly.3.  The "wide" bandwidth is useless to me.  There is no radio signal in my area strong enough for it.  I have to use the narrow setting, intended for weak and distant stations, for everything.Still, it's a heck of a radio for remote areas, for camping trips, or if you want to know how well a radio can work if somebody at the company gives a darn.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000J061

In an apartment the noise is increased by all the electrical devices used by the neighbours, so in my case it was very noisy making the RCA adapters a total waist of money. I found a similar device that uses 2.4GHz and it works great for me. But the device called DualJack could potentially interfere with other 2.4GHz signals like a computer wireless land or even wireless phones, so far I have not had any interference.

It works!  And I love it!  I can now sit in any chair of my house, surf the web, and print (across the room) to my wireless HP 995 Bluetooth printer.My system consists of two sets of RCA Wireless Modem Jacks (a sender and receiver unit in each set) -- one set for the upstairs and one set for the downstairs (which appear to be on separate circuits and are not connected); a 3Com Bluetooth PC card for my laptop; and a HP 995 Bluetooth printer.I now use my laptop in the following manner: first, I plug the RCA receiving unit into the wall outlet nearest where I want to sit; then I turn on the printer; and finally, I extend the little blue tooth-shaped antenna (how cute!) on the laptop's PC card -- and I'm all set to go!The RCA Modem Jack is good up to 56k, which is ok since I don't have internet cable or DSL service in my area.  But I'll gladly trade-off mobility for speed any day.  Here's why.My desktop computers (old and new) are in my upstairs bedrooms -- where I can't use them when my family is sleeping.  They are also far away from where my family spends most of its time -- and that's downstairs by the TV's.With the RCA wireless modem jacks, I can now access the internet --- while watching TV with my family; and I can surf the net long after everyone has gone to sleep -- when internet speeds are fastest.  The connection is fairly clean (free of static); and the transfer speed is nearly as fast as if I had accessed the phone jack directly.I've gotten very used to sitting in my favorite chair and surfing the net. When cable or DSL eventually come to my neighborhood, I guess I'll have to set up a wireless network in my home (for a lot more money) -- in order to maintain my mobility.Until then, I'll use the next best thing -- RCA's Wireless Modem Jacks.

I upgraded to a Map330 soon after trying the 315.<<<Having spent 2 hours with the Magellan 315 on a camping weekend in Arizona's mountains, I can say that the unit is all that's advertised. The manual is cryptic, but once you get used to the customizing menus and 9 available navigation screens, the rest is pretty intuitive. I was able to create a waypoint, walk half a mile away in the woods and return to within 20 feet. It works surprisingly well even in a rather heavy forest. It was showing an estimated RMS positional error of only 6 feet at one point! Routes are given in 1. foot increments when you are within .1 miles of your waypoint (with the updated software you can download from the Magellan website)! As long as you keep moving, the compass feature is quite good. It even displays the sun and moon locations versus the compass dial.Nice screen, plenty of options and quite accurate. When used in your car, it tracks your speed to .1 mph, with updates given each second.  If you are a hiker or hunter or fisherman or gizmo lover, this is a nice addition. I suspect on an open lake, this would be super for locating favorite fishing spots.<<<I have had my GPS for about a year now, and love it, but i have 2 problems with it, the interface is very difficult to use and tedious to search for a city or road.  By the time i find the place im trying to get ive passed it and gone another 20 miles.  Also, mine was working fine when suddenly one day i turned it on and it said it had no maps and i needed a upload.  So i downloaded the latest patch for it, and tried uploading with no success.  I have gotten a number from Magellan to return it, but lost the number (actually my dad did) So im returning it :(  but i must say it was great while it worked, and the tech support is fast and reliable.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000J0IX

I have found them absolutely useless at $10+ per kit.  I will continue to search for a product/system that REALLY works.<<<Been using this stuff for a couple years.  Works great for me. I use it different than the instruction.  Find a flat surface, lay a bundle of tissue on it, place the disk scratched face up.  Place a couple drops of #1 abrasive on the disk and immediately start wiping with some pressure radially outward (you don't have to wait 5 minutes).  Keep working your way around the disk until the solution is dry (about 5 minutes).  Spray once with #2, and using a clean TISSUE, continue wiping VERY GENTLY radially outward until #2 dries.  Try the disk.  If it doesn't work, repeat all the above until it does.  This really does work, but it can take some elbow grease and repeated tries depending on the severity of the scratches.  I've had a LOT of scratched disks, and I haven't found one yet that I couldn't fix with this.<<<This product is crap. I followed the instructions to the tiniest detail (I am a very methodical person) and it didn't remove the scratch that my DVD has and it added several more. I read other reviews of people who had a good experience by twisting the instructions, but I am not willing to do that; the manufacturer should know better how to make this product work. Following the instructions, it ruins your CD or DVD even further. Don't wast you time, money and your CD / DVD and take it somewhere where they can buff it.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000J1E6
MAXELL NORMAL BIAS UR-90 (15-Pack) Standard Size Cassettes:::B00000J1EP:::Accessories & Supplies:::<li>90 minutes recording time<li>All purpose tape for general use <li>Ideal for personal and portable cassette players				    						::::::Lycantis>>>Matthew G. Sherwin>>>MaxPower:::I ordered micro cassettes and got these, I was angered by the miscommunication and went with another seller, got exactly what I wanted so I am happy. I did not try these out. I don't have a standard cassette recorder.<<<Maxell manufactures excellent 90 minute cassette tapes for all purpose general recording. As long as you have the right kind of equipment, these tapes record the sounds of record albums, radio shows, CD-Rs, people talking and more. These tapes have 90 minutes worth of blank recording tapes on them so there are 45 blank minutes for recording on each side. The features of this tape, as one reviewer correctly notes, make it good for recording lectures and music using standard, less expensive home stereo equipment. The tape playback will work well in any basic tape deck including the one in your car.If you pay the Amazon price of $6.75 for the fifteen-pack you spend roughly 45 cents per tape and that's very inexpensive. The tapes allow you hours upon hours of listening enjoyment because you can record over them many times; and they take up very little room so they're easy to carry around with you.Unfortunately, these tapes cannot produce the same quality recording reproduction as a digitalized copy would give you. This means that if, hypothetically, you were to copy a CD-R onto another CD-R instead of a Maxell cassette tape, the quality of the sound on the CD-R copy would be sharper and clearer with less background noise than a Maxell cassette tape or any other brand of cassette tape could give you. Maxell also manufactures higher quality cassette tapes including the Maxell XL-II; but it's still not the same as a digitized CD-R recording. Moreover, cassette tapes can break if not handled with care. They can also break if used a few too many times, too. Therefore, I recommend that any important recorded material should be copied onto another blank tape and then keep that second tape in a safe place to use as a backup. These shortcomings frustrate me and therefore I will have to take off one star to make this a four star review.The tapes have small pieces of plastic on the narrow top of each cassette which you can punch out easily so that accidental recording over an existing recording is impossible. If you do wish to record over an original recording then you can merely place a small amount of regular tape over the hole. The cassette tape is now ready to record a fresh recording.Overall, Maxell makes a great choice when you want reliable cassette tapes to record music, the radio, people talking or anything you wish to record. I have used this brand for decades and I cannot think of any major complaints. I highly recommend Maxell normal bias 90 minute cassette tapes for you to use when you need to record something onto a tape.<<<So I acutally bought these tapes for an art project and I am not going to be "using" these at all.  I don't even have a tape player anymore.Both projects are lamps made out of either just the cassette tapes or the tapes in their cases.  Thought I would give both a try and see which I liked better.I really like the first one better, I bought different kinds of lights to try out inside the base.I have also seen people spray paint these neon colors and hang them from string in rooms, put on walls.  Fun art to remember a cool time when you rewound tapes with pencils so you didn't waste batteries. :P:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000J1EP

Belt>>>brilliantdude65:::Two relatives still have multiple VCRs and they tape a lot of stuff.  Tapes wear out over time so I buy them new tapes once a year or so.  These tapes are a very good price and last for a long time even though my Mom and aunt tape over them maybe hundreds of times in a year.  I have never gotten a "bad" tape or had tapes break.<<<If you have an old VCR that still works and you enjoy taping your TV shows you now know how hard it is to find tapes. This will more than likely become even harder.  We located these on Amazon. They are a great buy and are becoming very difficult to find. These Maxwell takes are of very good quality and the prices if fantastic.<<<The package arrived in about 6 days and in the advertised condition. I've bought Maxell products in the past(especially cassette audio tapes and vhs tapes) and have never been disappointed. The color and sound are both exceptional on these tapes. I know that the trend is changing and these tapes are going the way of the 8-track (and I'm trying to slowly make the change over to digital media) but in the meanwhile..I can highly recommend this Maxell 4-pk for your vcr recording needs.Also-this vendor appears to be a fine one.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000J1EQ
Maxell 213030 VHS T160 Standard Grade - 3 Pack:::B00000J1F3:::Camera & Photo:::Standard grade tape is economical for general use. T-160 provides 160 minutes of standard recording, 2.5 hours in SP mode and 8 hours in EP mode. Cassette Type: Video Cassette Size: N/A Grade/Quality: Standard Maximum Recording Time: 8 Hours.				    						:::https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/512Jm26y%2BoL._SX200_.jpg:::A.  MacGregor>>>Carol D. Pippin>>>CreateEnergy:::I have found Maxell to be one of the reliable VHS tapes.  (Sony and TDK I have always found good too.) For those who don't know, the 160 minute uses thinner tape in order to get it on the same reel as a 120.  When tape is thinner there is more possibility for the layers to stick to each other by static electricity. Therefore I don't recommend 160 for repeated reusing but for some long thing, or somethings adding up to 8 hours (at SP) to save and watch sometime.  The 120s I use and reuse a lot, and keep a lot too.  :-)  Long may the VCR's survive.P.S.  oooops! Made an error above.  I said 8 hrs. at SP. Of course, we all know SP is the fastest. LP or SLP - whichever your VCR has as slowest is what I meant. Fast speed recording is considered best by some. Pause at SP gives a jerky picture. At SLP you can pause and get a quite steady look at a particular shot, and the overall clarity and quality of the recording I consider quite OK.<<<These are wonderful for recording anything you like if you still have a VCR!  I will use them and order more!<<<I bought this pack specifically because each tape is 8 hrs long. This length is useful for recording sports programs especially that tend to run pretty long.The quality of the picture is still pretty good even at 8 hrs. So far I have had no problems with these tapes. I suggest cleaning the tape deck once in awhile to prevent your recordings from having that annoying picture noise.I got these at a good price(just under seven bucks) on Amazon. VHS tapes are difficult to find nowadays in a regular store so I am glad I can still purchase these on Amazon.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000J1F3

The phones are lightweight, comfortable, and the sound quality is good anywhere in our house &amp; yard. The quality of construction of the phones and the base unit is good. There is an ample supply of cables &amp; adapters, i.e., for plugging into  a computer soundcard.<<<I'm not brutal with equipment, but in a few short weeks, the flimsy plastic part that holds the ear pieces to the headset broke on one side. Within a month or two the other side went as well forcing me to use office paper clamps to hold the whole thing together.I use them in bed late at night when the household is asleep. A second convenient bedside charger would be nice. I tend to put them down on the bedside table before I doze off rather than get up and walk across the room hook it up for recharge. If you're a  late night TV watcher, you too might call this justifiable laziness. Too many times I put them on the next night and find the battery's down.I honestly think that before I replace them with another wireless, I'd find a way to sneak an extension wire across the room through attic or basement space and go with a standard wired headphone.<<<Terrific value for the money.  Sound is very clear and warm.  Upper range and midrange as good as very expensive corded  phones and speaker systems. The bass is not muddy, but it  is less pronounced than with good speakers or corded phones. But the overall sound is still excellent.Requires a good deal of adjustment and fiddling to get the best sound and longest transmition range out of it. Don't set the level on the transmitter too high. You will get speaker overload. You can listen throughout your home, patio, and garage.  But you generally get some bursts of static as you walk. None of these drawbacks bothers me.Best for listening to CD's. Sounds great with LP's too, but it transmits more groove wall noise and static than you  are probably used to hearing from the RIAA jacks that your turntable is connected to.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000J1GA

You insert the cleaner disk into your CD player and follow the directions, which are said aloud to you, and in no time the cleaning is done.

The overall construction surprised me too as they lasted several more seasons than I thought they would (6 years now and all year long outdoor usage). Due to the fact that I crank up the volume very high for when I'm mowing, or deep in the woods or having a crazy pool party, with or without other people  :)  ....  I'm now looking into buying a replacement for one speaker that seems to be on it's way out. It still puts out sound but poor quality compared to the other 3. Just a good all around speaker that does not break the bank.<<<These speakers sounded great but I do like to crank up the occasional KISS or VanHalen and these speakers just stopped working. I've never blown a speaker before but I guess that's what happened.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000J3G3

Motorola TalkAbout T280 2-Mile 14-Channel Two-Way Radio (Black):::B00000J3HB:::Portable Audio & Video:::Talkabout 280AA Graphite Black				    						::::::Laura Haggarty>>>Wayne J. Anderson>>>Acute Observer:::My husband, young daughters and I own horses, and trailride at least once a week. Santa brought us four of these lovely little two-ways this year at Christmas, and I couldn't be more pleased. We've had none of the troubles noted in the other reviews, (although we don't ride on mountaintops), and my children find the radios simple to use and easy to understand (not to mention the cool factor!).The radios are durable; we've dropped them in snowbanks, had them grawed on by curious horses, and thumped around in saddlebags. They're certainly useful, we know if one of us gets separated from the others they'll be able to radio in and figure out where we are. And for what we use them for, they're just perfect. We looked at a bunch of GPS handhelds, and decided we didn't need anything quite that high end. For the average family who hikes or skis, trailrides or just goes to the Mall of America, these are the perfect belt accessory. Go for it!<<<Fabulous product - works great - highly recommend - have used on my friends boat and it is great when we are on shore and need some one to come retrieve us - also works great on the boat that is 168 feet long<<<Iomega ZIP 100 Drive Parallel PortThis device has been in use since the mid-1990s. It allows both storage and transfer since it works on any parallel port, which should be defined as "bi-directional" or "EPP". For best results, you should run the "Parallel Port Accelerator" program when the unit is connected. Computers have a limit on the number of IDE devices, and desktop computers have a limited number of bays. The disks are easily replaced to provide vast storage within the 100Mb limit. This device must be connected when all power is off, like with a parallel port printer. Backing up a small amount of data is not a problem, but large amount of data files will run slowly. The fastest transfer is with an internal IDE ZIP device.The "User's Manual" warns against using the Operating System to copy a disk. Use the Iomega "Copy Machine" program. Right click on the ZIP drive to select the Iomega "Format" function. Use "Short Format" to delete all data on an Iomega disk. The "Long Format" repairs a drive with errors, converts from another format, or removes all passwords. "Write Protection" protects against writing over data, a password can protect against both reading and writing files. You can also flag the ZIP drive as "non-removable" so it appears like a hard drive. The manual has the details. Most printers will operate from the printer port on this unit. The manual offers suggestions if this doesn't work.Parallel Port drives have their drive letter(s) assigned after the hard drive. Another Parallel Port unit can be connected to the first ("daisy chaining"). This changes the drive letter(s) assigned to CD-roms. A USB drive has its drive letter assigned after the CD-rom drive letter(s). Both units have been proven useful over time. Will the data on a disk survive for over a decade? Not with some floppy disks. Few hard drives survive 10 years of daily use. All your important data files should be copied from a hard drive to ZIP drives or other media. ZIP drives, like floppies, should not be exposed to magnetic fields or high heat. CDs can be damaged by high heat. ZIP disks are reusable, replacing data does not decrease the size. A CD disk consumes space when a file is replaced. Both can have labels. Some say ZIP drives are obsolete, but not as long as it works for you. A ZIP disk has no compatibility problems between different systems and computers. A CD written on one system may not be updated by a different system.To test the status of a used ZIP disk. 1) Right click on the drive, select `Properties'. 2) Select the Iomega tab (after support was installed). 3) Select `Diagnostics', then `Close' after the green light. 4) Select `More Info' on the `Disk Type' Note the `Disk Life Status' and the `Format Life Status'. Percentages lower than about 85% are not good. 5) A `Long Format' can improve the Life Status statistics.If your system does not recognize your used parallel port drive (Add New Hardware Wizard), select the hardware from the list: "SCSI controllers", "Iomega", "Iomega Parallel Port Interface", then "Finish".:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000J3HB
Iomega 10919 Zip 100 Drive  (Parallel Port):::B00000J3II:::Computers & Accessories:::The Iomega 100MB Parallel Port Zip Drive stores up to 100MB of data on Iomega Zip Disks.

The included Iomega software will not work with newer versions of Windows but should be able to read and write with native Windows drivers.<br><br>NOTE: IomegaWare is not compatible with Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8. Zip Parallel Port drives are not supported on any current computers or operating systems.				    						::::::ODB>>>pat>>>Shelley Gammon "Geek":::I have enjoyed the convenience of my zip drive-  My university's graphics computers have zip drives, the local Kinkos have zip drives in their computers, my parents even have a zip drive now.  Its a nice, accepted standard, and for the price the disks read fast and work well- unlike 3.5  floppies, no zip disk has ever corrupted data for me. Zip disks are made of  sturdy plastic which you can safely keep in your (shirt) pocket without  damage.The strongest competetitor to the zip disk standard is the 120 MB  super-drive, which is a drive that is backwards-compatible with 1.6 MB  (traditional)3.5 floppies, so you can totally replace your old floppy drive  and still have it when you need it.  A couple years ago it was expected  that this drive would blow Iomega zip out of the picture, but  super-floppies haven't really caught on.In terms of exchanging data  between computers in the same house, it is suprisingly simple to run an  ethernet network instead- and there are other advantage besides transfering  files- such as printer sharing and web sharing.-Note.  I think the zip  100 is more functional for the price than the 250 zip. -(For backing up  really large files, the best thing these days is a cd writer or re-writer.)<<<this thing is now just a blue brick in the corner of my room. i tried to download the driver from a website but no such website exists. i could download it from the from pirate bay, but that's illegal and unsafe. so i have all these pictures of dear family members (some of them are dead), and i can't retrieve them!<<<I'm a Mac user, but I also have a Windows PC in my office. My workplace has over 1,000 employees and the majority of them are on Windows, while I am one of 3 people in the organization that consistently uses a Mac.I am sent files all the time via the Network GroupWare e-mail system. I never wanted to hook my Mac up through all the logging in and everything involved in a Novell system, so I never got the Mac version of the software to connect my Mac fully to the network.So, when someone sends me a file via GroupWise, I copy the attachment onto my ZIP disk and then eject that disk and put it in my Mac to work on the file.  Not the most efficient way to go about things, but this 100MB Iomega ZIP drive hasn't failed me once in the past 4 years.Since the Mac OS can read both Mac and PC ZIP disks, I use PC formatted disks and move them back and forth from Windows (the Parallel drive) to Mac (the factory installed 250MB drive) all day long.ZIP disks can hold an equivalent of about 74 floppy disks and the speed is lightning fast when compared to floppies. My only gripe is that Iomega does not make these drives with an on/off switch... even if your computer is off for a week, you've got to unplug your ZIP drive if you don't want it to eat up electricity. Honestly, I doubt that a little ZIP drive that isn't spinning a disk uses more than a single kilowatt hour per month, but it's a waste nonetheless.  This one gripe wasn't enough of a drawback to take a star away from the 5 star rating I'm giving this gizmo.  It's dependable, it's fast and ZIP is an industry standard. Hats off to Iomega.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000J3II

I then had to convert to a current word processing software, OpenSource.Org and then my intent was to plug this Zip Drive into my iMac and copy all those newly translated files to the iMac. But for some reason my iMac couldn't &#34;see&#34; or read the Iomega Zip Drive (it &#34;saw&#34; it at the USB Hub). So I had to buy a flash drive to copy those files from the eMac. Then I was able to copy to the iMac from the flash drive.  (Their Customer Support said the drive had been tested through MAC OS 10.6 and it worked fine [have 10.7.5, Mountain Lion]).  In a round about way, the technology served its purpose!  Thank goodness.  (The Seller was quick in responding to my questions.  Good Customer Service.)<<<I bought this to read some old Zip disks I had lying around. I wanted to save the old files. I bought my Zip drive from third-party seller ElizabethLeeHR and even though it was used, it ran on my Win7 laptop flawlessly. No driver needed; pure plug-n-play!

I don't think it "magically" reset its own combination. Mechanical locks don't do that. More likely the rotating mechanism that allows the lock to unlock got jammed. My IT guy had to saw it off. Did some damage to the cosmetics of my company laptop.Simply put: Don't use this product.Great while it worked. Imagine getting it jammed at a coffee house rather then your office or home. Yikes.<<<I travel with my notebook in my backpack. I have had three of these things. You have to read the instructions to set the combination correctly!They all have worked well and they NEVER have changed the combination on me spontaneously!The newer model has the same features but uses AAA bats and not a 9V which the old one used.  It is thiner than the old model also.  I like the blinking red light when ever I arm it.  I run the cable through my zipper on my backpack and leave in strapped to the desk or chair in my hotel room.  It  creates a shrill LOUD alarm (if you set it for this feature) when the unit is moved.  There are two sensitivities.  You can set it to only alarm if the cable is cut.  Yes you can cut the cable with a good set of wire cutters...so it would not stop anyone determined to take your notebook from you and had strong intentions to do so.  It will stop someone from just grabbing it and trying to run.I also really like the little gadget in the photo...(lower right hand corner of photo) it fits into the security hole of my notebook very snugly.  The cable of the Defcon can go through the hole of this gadget and you can just lay it next to your notebook and it will start to "scream" as soon as the notebook is moved (it does give you a ~15 second warning before "screaming" with a loud CHIRP sound, so you can disarm it.  Go to Targus website and check it out.  I don't work for them.  I do believe they sell a quality little alarm.  It is not Fort Knox,  it is a lot better than nothing.  Blinking light and siren deters the common dumb criminal (not on drugs or really crazy)from taking your computer.  It's should be just one of a series of methods you have to secure your notebook, not the only one.It's nice for travel.  You can even hang the thing on a door knob and know if someone opens the door.  It's a motion alarm with a blinking red light.  The number of blinks tells you how it is armed. I recommend it.<<<This is not a review of the product but I thought this information may be good to know before you order. Could save someone money and frustration.I ordered this Defcon 1 unit (~$34) in April 2013, and received a Devcon CL (combination lock and cable ~$21) that was improperly labled with an Amazon SKU label listed improperly as a Defcon 1 unit. It arrived in a clear plastic pack so I could see it was the wrong item. If I did not have Prime it would likely have cost me shipping. Prime enabled me to return it and get a full refund, so I was OK with this. Just FYI, if you are ordering this and paying for shipping.It looked like a good device and was recommended to lock down a ~$300 RV voltage protector that can be stolen easily while camping. But, rather than risk another mislabeled device from the same Amazon seller, I opted to use something else.  Amazon may not charge shipping if one re orders when this happens, but you would probably lose it if you requested a refund.Be aware this is the FIRST time an Amazon seller has done this to my knowledge in over 15 years of business with Amazon (I am very happy with Amazon and appreciate their costomer service), so I just wanted to help if you pay for shipping.

I bought in 2009 and I used on september 2012. for first time because I needed. I had a very % dollars cheap ruler extension same like this but cheap. I needed this for split the power overloading on my other extension, because the other one when overloaded pops up the switch and turns off, so i split the power and it was everything ok, and then this surge arrest protector starts burning inside and smelling to burnt plastic. Me and my roomate saw it and yes, the power cable was hot as hell as it might be on for hours at full capacity and then the inside of the surge arrest start somking so we unpluged, and if it wasnt because of the fact we were there and realized this happen, what if we just leave and leave this protector running, I am sure we might found a big fire when we might come back. In other words I had to put this in trash because it has no such a protection, my 5 dollar protector "extension" workd better than this pice of s*** because that one when it is over loaded automatically pops up the power button and turns off but dont got burnt. BE CAREFULL PELASE AND SAVE MONEY. Just keep an eye  on this, if you use normally might work fine but if you kind of overload with too much electric devices all of them runing this will NOT PROTECT INSTEAD THIS WILL BURN YOUR HOUSE Try by yourself if not beleive it. if this might be a trully protector might turn it off automatically when overload but this keeps running till gots on fire.<<<I used my 8-outlet SurgeArrest protector to protect my home office equipment. One day, "POOF" went my computer during a quick power outage. The incoming power surge when the power came back on was too much for APC to handle.Sent my unit in for eval, as they request. They said that since there was no evidence of a failure of their product, they would NOT compensate me for my power supply and motherboard being fried.Are they too dense to understand that if their product fails to stop a surge, it may be a case of the MOVs NOT blowing? MOVs are designed to take the hit and suffer the damage, protecting your electronics from the surge. Their device failed to stop a surge, failing to protect my equipment!My advice - if your equipment and data are valuable to you, then purchase one of the "series-based" surge protectors (APC does not make these). As they say, you get what you pay for. Except with APC, who fail to honor their warranties.For those who insist on using cheap surge protectors, I hope you protect your vehicles with a good set of Deer Whistles. Same sales principle - make them cheap enough for everyone, spin a marketing campaign stating they do the job, then rake in the profits while benefiting from consumers who will either not report a failure, or who will whimper quietly off into the sunset without complaining or sharing their experiences with the worthless product. If APC sold Deer whistles, and a deer hits your car, they would avoid fulfilling their warranty because the whistles are not defective.The product may not have failed mechanically or electronically, but it certainly FAILED to provide protection. Pay up, APC!<<<I purchase this item in Amazon. Which I purchase a lot of things in Amazon.

Parry:::I bought my SP3 when I moved to the Washington DC area, and have to say it works great.  I am never lost and it can find nearly everything.  There are a few streets that have no numbers in Arlington, but otherwise it is pretty good.I have also used the SP when traveling to other areas.  The one issue that I have is that it has a hard time keeping a good signal in the city because of all the buildings.  DC is not too bad, but I have had bigger problems in places like NYC and Toronto with the tall skyscrapers.  If it is plotting a course for you, you might miss a turn because it loses the signal for a few seconds.  To make things worse, since there is such a grid in the cities, it often takes a while to recalculate the course, by which point you might be lost again.  I find times when I need to pull off and wait for the GPS to catch up.I would highly recommend it if you travel a lot, or are unfamiliar with an area, just be careful if you are using it for large cities.<<<First I want to say I am very happy with the talking SPIII.  It is does a pretty good job routing and if you drive off the route it will autorecalc a new route for you. I have used numerous GPS's in the past and this does a great job for driving (for biking or hiking I HIGHLY recommend the Garmin 12 Map, my favorite GPS).Now there are some things to know about this product however.  First you get a CD that allows you to download maps from your PC to your Steetpilot.  It works over either serial or USB (USB goes to a 32MB memory card that you can plug in).  The CD contains maps of the US BUT... you only get to select one region of the US for free.  The rest of them you must pay for from Garmin for approx $116 a shot ($291 total for the total US).  You can purchase this online at Garmin's web site and they will give you a key to open up the different regions. The base map. the one built into the Garmin, on the GPS is still &quot;good&quot; for the whole US but the CD give MUCH better detail.  I am not complaining about this since the maps seem pretty up to date.  The road I live on is 2 years old and no other mapping software to my knowledge has it as part of their data but the Garmin software did.Another thing to note is the form factor for the StreetPilot III and the older street pilots are different.  this can be important if you order from Garmin direct accessories like the bean bag mount (as I found out).<<<Please allow me to preface this review with the fact that I have absolutely no sense of direction.  For those with excellent sense of direction, this may seem like an extravagant purchase until they come down in cost.I had to travel to California recently (I only lived there my whole life before 1999), but since I had never driven in California before, I was quite nervous about doing so.  The rental car had a GPS very similar to the Street Pilot, and using that gave me a great sense of confidence in driving around.Shortly after my return I realized how badly we needed a GPS in our car.  The Street Pilot was the best option for us because it has all the features of a factory-installed auto GPS, but the added convenience of being portable- now when I head out of town I can take the Street Pilot rather than having to rent a car with a GPS.  Not to mention the Street Pilot is about 1/2 to 1/3 of the cost of a factory-installed system.Some of the other reviewers have complained about how long it takes the Street Pilot to recalculate a route once the vehicle has gone off-route.  I have intentionally gone off-route several times just to see how it performs, and I have been very pleased.  It does take a few seconds, but from my experience it did not take so long that I got any further off-course than I already was.A feature that I found to be very helpful in the Street Pilot which was not in the rental car's GPS is a search by company name.  If you're looking for a department store, but you can't remember its address, just search by the name, and the Street Pilot will navigate you to the closest one. If you're looking for that great Chinese restaurant a couple of miles away, but you can't remember the name, you can search for Chinese restaurants in your area and find the correct one based on its address.  Want to order ahead, or put your name on the seating list?  Once the Street Pilot finds the restaurant you're looking for, it displays their phone number on the monitor as well.About the only two complaints I have about the Street Pilot are very trivial.  On the rental car I used, the GPS would automatically lower the volume on the stereo when the GPS needed to announce an instruction.  Being an external unit, the Street Pilot does not have this luxury.  Since I tend to listen to music, well, at ear-splitting volume while driving, it does take a little getting used to lowering the volume when using the Street Pilot around town, but again, this is a very minor complaint given all of the positive features the Street Pilot has.My other complaint is that occasionally it does give directions which are not the most direct route.  I used this on a trial basis in areas I was familiar with just to see how it performs, and I did find myself thinking on occasion "why is it telling me to go this way, when that way is much more direct?"  Especially since I live within a half an hour of Garmin's world headquarters, it would seem to me that they would at least know the most direct routes around here!  But even at this, the Street Pilot DOES get you to the correct destination every time, even if it sometimes takes an indirect route.I noticed that the package includes both a beanbag mount and a permanent dashboard mount for the Street Pilot.  Since Street Pilots have a way of being swiped, my suggestion would be to always use the beanbag mount, since a permanent mount could cause thieves to break into the car to find the GPS that is no longer in the car.  I drive a new Jetta, and I did not want to get sticky stuff all over my dashboard, so I chose to try out the beanbag.  It does not slip, even when making sharp turns.  I suppose if I were in a collision this would not be the case, but in normal driving, the beanbag is great.Of course, as others have advised, do not leave your Street Pilot in the car unattended for any reason.  But given the fact that you're going to be spending around $1G for this puppy you probably already knew that.And one other safety feature that I think is great, but others might be annoyed by it: once you are driving, you cannot change the destination; it goes into a secure mode.  To change the address, you need to stop the car.  This may be a nuisance to some, but given how badly people drive while talking on cell phones, it's probably best that Garmin tries to curb people from pressing all sorts of buttons on their GPS while zipping down the road at 75 MPH.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000J40X

I don't worry about it  falling over since the charge is so sturdy. I love the case because it  provides such great protection in a stylish manner. enjoy!<<<Very nice. My Palm Vx fits in it & is Protected. It is also shiny<<<This case has worked great for me! It protects your Palm V from falls, spills, and related &quot;accidents&quot; I also like the look of the case a lot. It blends well with the design of the Palm V. The only  &quot;cons&quot; I could find to this case is that It will add weight and  size to your palm. Nonetheless, it is well worth the protection you get  (Plus, this will fix the problem the Palm V has with its regular cover of  turning itself on).  Sure, you'll have to pull the Palm V out of the case  to HotSync, but that will only take 2 secs. I love my hard case, and it has  certainly lived up to its job of protecting my Palm.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000J434

Somebody could have sat on it and it would've been fine...<<<If you have a lot of DVDs or CDs these wallets are the way to go. I have over 800 CDs and they were eating up my space. After getting rid of all the jewel cases I can store all of my CDs and DVDs on one book shelf. And since I organized them by theme, it is easy to find what I am looking for. By the way: you can mark the outside of the wallets with a  white-out pen. It makes it easy to know what's inside each wallet.  For the DVD wallet you will need to do a little trimming for some of the Liner notes. But it is easy to do. Trust me... once you start using these wallets, you'll love 'em. For what you get with these wallets I find the price fair. Even better here on Amazon.com Enjoy<<<CaseLogic has set the standard for media storage, and this continues the tradition. A few tweaks are needed, however. I am certain that I will soon fill the 20 slots. Therefore, it would be helpful to have a clear plastic sleeve on the spine for inserting a title or index to avoid having to open each case in search of a specific disk. The graphics sleeves are small enough that considerable trimming of the original case graphics is needed. Actually, I would prefer that the DVD companies would make their graphics more easily adaptable to the album rather than the other way around.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000J4CX

This comes with 3 plastic discs and a tube of superglue.Good points: thick cable, discs stick well.Bad points: cable only works with discs (not lock slots) or holes it can pass through. I don't want to stick a disc to my computer, so I'm using my old lock for it.<<<I have been using this for a while to secure a monitor and two external hard drives. One of the hard drives died and I wanted to secure its replacement, so ordered another set. While waiting I wondered if I could get the plastic anchor off and re-use it. I set it on a table, placed a putty knife at the joint, and with one feeble blow popped it off. Now I don't feel as secure. The epoxy that came with the set worked fine, but didn't bond to the hard drive's plastic case as strongly as I would have expected.<<<Hopefully, I never have to find out whether these are affective or not, so I can only comment on the concept.  You can either tie two things to a stable, heavy object such as a big desk, or you can tie three pieces of hardware together (such as in the picture) and make it a pain in the behind for someone to take all three at once and walk out your door. Of course, none of that matters if the person knows you have the cable and brings a snazzy pair of bolt cutters.  I haven't seen a product like this before, so I was thrilled to install it (it took 5 minutes); it's a better deterrent than the more popular kensington slot locks but will leave a gray lock on whatever you put it on, so choose wisely.  In the end, as with most inexpensive security devices, it's really about the piece of mind, rather than the effectiveness of the product.

"Art">>>Brian Dobben "engineering manager":::A quick take on my perception of the good and bad points of this device, and some suggestions from a vetran Palm upgrader (I've returned and repruchased these machines a little too many times!)There are a few  things I love about this device:1. You don't end up changing batteries  all the time like you did with previouis models 2. It costs lesser than the  Palm Vx 3. Synchronization with outlook 2000 is flawless 4. The screen is  very readable in bright outdoors 5. The battery lasts and lasts (they  aren't energizer bunnies!)Things I do not like about this:1. The  choice of cases for this are kind of lousy. 2. Applications built into this  device could have been a little more intuitive.Overall perceptions:1.  Good value for the money 2. Buy a spare docking cradle if you move this  between home and work PCs (accompany sells them for dirt cheap if you are  in the right buying cycle) 3. Do not attempt to browse the Web on  this...you'll only be disappointed.<<<I had trouble the first week getting the Palm to hotsync to my Thinkpad, and the Palm 5 even crashed once, losing all my data before the hotsync was working.Since then this thing has become an essential part of my life.  Works like a charm, both the Palm 5 itself and the hotsync too.  Address  book, calendar, notes...  The Palm is easily the best designed  hardware/software since the Macintosh of the late 1980's.By the way, I  am also using the Franklin/Covey software for personal management and find  this is a nice increment over the built-in daily task list of the Palm.<<<I've had my Palm V since June 1st. To my brother, wife &amp; parents who conspired for my birthday: THANK YOU!!!!!  Within two weeks I abandoned my Franklin Planner, and regretted not having had a Palm device 15 years ago.  OK, that was impossible - but it has dramatically changed my life for the  better, and I can't imagine ever going without it. In the last several  months I have grown to be a very definite power user, and the corporate  resource person for Palm-platform PDA's. Our guys have tried several others  and are convinced that the Palm platform is the best and most flexible.  I  am very heavily into 3rd-party software evaluation (&amp; some  accessories), preparing recommendations for high-efficiency Palm  device/software packages for company-staff issue. Eventually I may put  together my own personal web-site, and post some evaluations and  recommendations for software/accessories for Palm users.Having said all  that, here's an engineer's (my)perspective on the Palm V: Visors will be  great, and Palm IIIx's are just fine, but the Palm V package size is  definitely worth a lot to me. Forget the sexy appearance - it's great, but  the superior Form Factor rules. Yes, I would prefer that the Vx cost is  about what the standard V discounts for now, but since it will ALWAYS fit  in my shirt pocket (without changing my shirt wardrobe) I ALWAYS have it  with me (in a place that's probably least susceptible to being damaged or  lost) - and that's what it's for. Though I prefer to use the slim padded  3COM case, I frequently slip the original leather flap-cover on for small  shirt pockets, &amp; thus can still carry a separate pen/pencil/stylus  device. A big plus with those covers that I've never seen in a review: the  soft "grabby" texture of the rubber-like spine flex keeps the Palm from  sliding, even if you do toe-touches. Ta-dah... it doesn't fall out on the  floor!!!!  (Very big benefit since the cover isn't a padded case.)Likes:  I like being able to keep synced with both my office laptop and my home  desktop (with the included MS Outlook Conduit)... autocharging in the docking  cradle... a battery that's never gotten below a half-charge... nice screen...  the size.  I really like the unit overall - a truly great device.Any  problems? Yep. I did have to get the updated e-mail patch from the Chapura  site to avoid some lock-ups when synching e-mail.  Also, I highly recommend  TealScript (the custom-tailorable graffitti add-on) for it's ability to  help you tune up your handwriting speed/recognition - and it visually  showed up a mysterious problem with the screen occasionally screwing up  handwriting by adding a horizontal line: 3-COM quickly replaced it under  warranty, and it's been fine.Memory space? The average user probably  will have no problem for a couple of years - I've met people with III's  that are using less than 1k... a year after they get it: they've seen &amp;  use very few aftermarket programs. However, I've got more programs in there  than will fit: launcher, datebook, calc &amp; memo replacements, travel  programs, doc reader, picture viewer, several clocks, a dozen utility and  security programs, over a dozen Hackmaster hacks, and a few games. Since  FlashPro gave me the extra 800k memory room (awesome), I found I probably  had enough that I could otherwise get by fine without deleting rarely-used  fluff programs - except that I use it heavily for work &amp; software  evaluation. The memory room of the Vx would be heaven - the perfect device,  I think. It'd be handy to carry a lot of maps, but my current standard P5  doesn't have the memory room without deleting, say, my picture viewer. (Oh,  the screen? It's great! Yes folks, it IS a 16 greyscale display!) Probably  I'll upgrade to the Vx &amp; give my wife my standard V (P5) unit: she  thought it was no big deal when I got it, but has fallen in love with the  capabilities and wants her own Palm device. Bottom line is that if you're a  minimalist, the 2k of P5 memory is fine. But if you like to carry a  Gerber/Leatherman/Swiss-Army device (like I do) because a pocketknife  leaves you unprepared... better get a Vx or get the 8mb upgrade on your  P5.Price? When Handspring comes out with something to compete with a Vx,  the price world will probably be great. Yeh, P5's are expensive compared to  some of the lesser PDA's - but compare the price to a palmtop computer, and  they look like a great deal... especially considering the impact on your  lifestyle.Can I mention my essential add-on programs list? Tough area,  but currently I wouldn't give up these - listed in order of descending  requirement: UnDupe (get it!), TealScript, Travel Clock, Hackmaster,  (SwitchHack, StayOffHack, PalmV hack, Invert Hack &amp; Invert, FindHack,  CatHack), DateBK3 (&amp; dbScan), BackupBuddy, IDPalm, FlashPro, a good  launcher - either Commander or LaunchEm have too many great enhancements to  do without. Must-have accessories: WriteRight screen covers, Throttle  Stylus/pen. I regard the PalmV hack and StayOff hack as absolute essentials  for Palm V users, and Invert with InvertHack give proper screen display  when the backlight's on.  In-depth info?  O'Reilly's "Palmpilot: The  Ultimate Guide" is a fantastic reference for ALL Palm owners.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000J4FS

Hubs are difficult to find these days as low cost network switches are a dime a dozen, and provide isolation between network ports.But for network hardware development you do not want this isolation when you are trying to monitor network traffic between devices.  That is where an Ethernet Hub comes in.  Yes you can use "managed" network switches but those are more expensive than the garden variety network switch.This Hub was available at a fair price, and works fine.  If I need another one I would purchase again.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000J4LQ
Netgear EN104TP 4-Port 10 Mbps Ethernet Hub RJ-45 with Uplink Button:::B00000J4M9:::Computers & Accessories:::Netgear (EN104TPNA) HUB 4-PORT 10MBPS SLIMLINE				    						::::::Joseph Chiu>>>Michael A. Brown "maniacmedia">>>Michael Smith:::Our office used to use a handful of the EN-104 4-port hubs and some of the EN-108 (the 8-port version of the same product).As 10 Mbps hubs go, the EN-104's are really nice.The quality of NetGear equipment has always impressed me:-  Nice sturdy metal construction instead of plastic.-  Status indicators built into the jacks, so you can easily tell which cable is connected and is active.-  Right-angled barrel power connector which reduce the likelihood of disconnecting power accidentally.-  With an easy-to-access switch, Port 1 toggles between station mode and uplink mode.  Unlike some hubs where two jacks are wired together, this design prevents accidentally shorting a station to an uplink.-  Screw-mount notches on the underside allows for easy attachment to the wall, underside of a counter, etc.If you want to set up a network without spending much, these hubs work well.  However, I suggest you buy a 10/100 Mbps hub instead.Here's why:Practically all new networkable devices today support 100 Mbps (FastEthernet) as well as 10 Mbps (Ethernet).  The EN-104 hub (and other 10 Mbps hubs) will limit you to the slower speed.As 10/100 Mbps hubs are readily available today, and are quite affordable, I think your money is better spent on the faster hub.Is there a noticeable difference between 10 Mbps and 100 Mbps?  It depends on your usage, but if you regularly work with files larger than about 300 KBytes or larger, you'll notice a tangible difference.  For truly large files (like graphics/movies, or when installing an application via a network drive), a 10 second transfer at 100 Mbps will take well over a minute at 10 Mbps.If the NetGear 10/100 hub (DS-104) is a bit too pricey for you, you might consider the Linksys EFAH05W 10/100 hub.  Though not as &quot;nice&quot; as NetGear equipment, the Linksys 10/100 hub is only a few dollars more than this NetGear 10 Mbps hub.<<<My cable modem makes for great, fast internet access... for one computer. But what about downloading updates for my iBook without disconnecting my iMac? This hub has done that with ease. Easy to follow instructions had my home network up and running within ten minutes. Never a problem since.<<<For just a simple 10 Mbps hub, this is an excellent one for the price. It is compact and sturdy, especially with the metal casing. Link and status lights are handy along with the Normal/Uplink switch. No software installation needed - plug the power in and the CAT cables and you're all set!:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000J4M9

It has room for everything I need for the camera.  The camera itself, battery charger, an extra set of batteries, a couple of extra media cards, the accessory cords for downloading.  All this fits into the bag very securely, without everything banging into each other, because of the pocket dividers.The bag is not too bulky, rather compact with padding.

There is plenty of room left for cables, a flash or even another camera if you've got one.  A mesh pouch on the inside of the main compartment flap offers a handy place to store my SM cards.  On the other side, another component offers 4 elastic loops for batteries,  and 2 mesh pouches (1 zippered) for storing more batteries or whatever else you might have.  I can easily store 3 sets of 4 AA batteries in here, with plenty of room for more SM cards.  And to top it all off, a zippered side pouch for another place to put stuff (nothing too thick though).  There's an adjustable carry strap that you can use to sling over your shoulder, plus handles on the top and side, so there are plenty of ways to grab onto the bag.  The only think I don't like about this bag is that mine doesn't seem to want to stand up.  It always ends up rolling over onto its back.

I decided to add DVD capability to this system, in order to enjoy a movie at my work desk whenever the mood strikes me to take a break from work (which happens quite frequently).  I added a Sony DVD player, this particular Soundblaster soundcard, and a pair of Cambridge Soundworks speakers.  Within thirty minutes, I was watching The Lord of Rings.Now, about the Soundblaster.  This is a very good Soundcard for its intended purpose.  Which is to provide basic sound functionality to a desktop computer.  The sound quality is good enough to enjoy listening to stereo sounds from music CDs and DVDs.  But please, do not expect this card to provide you with theatre-like surround sound quality.  This is definitely the wrong price range if you need that kind of quality.I compared the sound quality of this office system to my primary home system.

I switched the mode of operation of the Altec Lansings from surround to stereo for comparison purposes between the two systems.  Subjectively, you can definitely tell the difference between the two.I can recommend this Soundblaster to anyone who is simply looking to add stereo sound to his or her desktop computer.  It is inexpensive and easy to install.  It will require the use of one of your PCI slots.  For your information, I installed this card on an IBM 300PL desktop PC.  The system has a Pentium III processor and 128 MB of RAM.  It is running an evaluation copy of Windows 2000 Advanced Server.  The DVD player is a Sony DDU1621 and the Monitor is a KDS 17 inch flat screen CRT.  If you are interested, I wrote reviews on the KDS monitor and the Sony DVD player, here at Amazon.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000J506
Creative Labs Sound Blaster 16 PCI Sound Card:::B00000J579:::Computers & Accessories:::Based on the award-winning Sound Blaster 16 technology, this easy-to-use, general-purpose sound card provides CD-quality stereo sound great wave-table music without overtaxing your CPU. Ideal for home, business, and Internet use, you'll notice the difference in your music and Windows multimedia. Plug-and-Play support is built-in for easy setup, and the system is compatible with all of the standard technologies, including positional 3D sound compatibility for expansive sound on headphones or traditional 2-speaker configurations. For highest sound quality, every signal is processed and mixed with a 16-bit digital audio engine. The included bundled software allows you to play and record your own sounds and music, and experience real-time streaming Internet audio.				    						:::https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41DFMYJ8GPL._SX200_.jpg:::Keith Tokash "twigles">>>Mr. A. Pomeroy>>>Scott Reynolds:::This is a basic sound card.  Nothing fancy.  The thing that seperates it from the rest is that Creative is a huge company and has drivers available for all Windows (the Linux/BSD world probably supports this thing, I haven't checked).  This is as close to plug and play as you can get.That guy who ranted about this card crashing his system needs to buy a clue and check his IRQs, not to mention dump Windows ME (which *Microsoft* doesn't even stand by).<<<Essentially, this is the entry-level, 16-bit audio Creative Labs sound  card. It has a built-in mock '3D' stereo effect, a 128-voice MIDI  wavetable, and it can sample at up to 48khz in 16-bit stereo, and that's  about all there is to it. Whilst it doesn't do anything wrong in itself  (it's plug-and-play, so if you're using Windows it should work out of the  box), the Soundblaster Live isn't much more expensive, and offers  environmental audio.If you only dabble with music and don't play many  new games it's a perfectly adequate solution, however.<<<This is a basic low-end sound card. It puts out pretty good sound for most things you do on your computer. It comes with some ok software and all the cables to connect to your cd-rom drive so you can rip your cds directly from the cd-rom. The drivers are included for all windows including xp.Why you wouldn't want this cardIf you are a gamer or listen to high quality mp3 (over 128 bitrate), 128 or less will sound fine with this cardI don't understand people having driver support because creative labs is the biggest sound card company on the market and one thing you will not have to worry about is driver support with any current or future versions of windows:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000J579
Bushnell 131650 Powerview Porro Prism Binocular with 16x Magnification and 50mm Lens:::B00000J6WY:::Camera & Photo:::The Power View series offers the largest line of Bushnell-quality, affordable binoculars. No matter what your purpose, you'll find a variety of magnifications, styles and sizes, and multi or fully-coated optics for bright, vivid images. Standard-size porro models feature Insta-Focus for fast and easy focus on moving targets.				    						:::https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51pynTfzcsL._SX200_.jpg:::D. Johnson "Chi-Town Dale">>>Eldho Thomas>>>H. A. Syed:::I was really looking forward to getting these binoculars. I had owned Bushnell binoculars in the past and was very happy with them.These arrived totally broken.The left main lens housing was sheared completely off from the unit.Looking at them, I found they were constructed using cheap plastic for the main body. The lens housings are screwed into the body, but the plastic is so fragile that apparently when they were dropped sometime during the shipping process the plastic shattered.I probably could have Super-glued the housing back on but then they would have been subject to fogging since when the housing broke off the Nitrogen that is injected into the housing escaped. Nitrogen is used to prevent the lenses from fogging.While checking out the remainder of the unit, I worked with the quick focus lever and found that it didn't hold focus very well either. I would like to see a unit that has a dial focus with a lever fine focus so that the major focus point is stable. The lever focus would be really nice for finer focusing after you have zeroed in on the subject. I would have used them for viewing auto racing for the most part, so once you get the major focus point clear, a lever focus for fine focusing would be great for viewing a moving target like race cars that can vary in distance by up to 1/4 of a mile closer or further than the main focus point as the cars travel around the track. That is where the quick focus lever could do a great job. But to use it for the entire focus field is too much and it isn't fine enough since a tiny bump in the wrong direction can cause you to lose sight of your target object entirely.I also agree that the design of the focus bar is poor in that you have to use both hands to focus since you can only push down. Either that or if you have a long finger you can reach across the center and push down on the other side of the bar as well.I won't be reordering a replacement. Instead I will look for binoculars that have a more durable housing since using binoculars subjects them to being "knocked around" and if the material used by Bushnell shatters so easily, they are not going to last very long.So my advice to anyone who owns these particular binoculars is to protect them from being dropped or even bumped into trees, etc very hard since the housing is brittle and will shatter. If you use them in Winter, they will be even more brittle and the housing will shatter even more easily than in warm weather like we have now.I would also advise Bushnell to change their packaging since if they make a product that is this fragile they should pack it in thicker shock absorbing materials than they currently do since what they use wouldn't protect a product a fraction of the weight and bulk of this product. That would lessen the chance of catastrophic damage such as these were obviously subjected to.My cell phone, which weighs 3.5 ounces came in a corrugated box with a total weight of one pound with 10 ounces of that being the box and packing materials (the charger weighs about 2 oz).Yet these binoculars that weigh 12 TIMES as much as my cell phone, with optics that are far more vulnerable to damage from the shocks of shipping and handling than a cell phone have only a couple of ounces of material to protect them from damage and came in a box no sturdier than a cereal box. It is a miracle if any of these binoculars get to the customer in one piece!<<<This is a good binoculars. It is clear and light. Buy it only if you really need 16x magnification. At times, you will wish you didn't have so much of magnification. My next binoculars will be one with zoom !The carrying case is cheap-looking (so is the neck strap).<<<Bought this in 2004 and it going great. 16x50 is on the higher end and I would recommend a smaller one because slight shake in the hand makes the objet move a lot, otherwise eit is good.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000J6WY

Jewell>>>Adam Sacks>>>J. Ratliff:::This RIO model is a nifty music device.  Compact size, fantastic sound quality, no skipping, and easy transfer of music from a computer.  On the other hand, it only holds six or seven songs, the door on the battery case  doesn't stay shut so well after a few months of use, and a little abuse,  and the &quot;hold&quot; switch gets sticky after a while and becomes  difficult to move.  If you can find it on the cheap it's a cool toy,  otherwise wait for a newer model or get some other technology to fire up  your tunes.<<<The RIO rocks! It is so great that Diamond Multimedia prevailed in their fight against the forces of pure evil in the music industry and allowed us, the public, to have the RIO! This little baby holds your MP3's and plays  them with outrageous quality and no moving parts! You simply cannot make  the music &quot;skip&quot;. Take it jogging, bob sledding, whatever! The  Rio is cute and compact, battery lasts forever, runs great and is really  simple to use. Works well with the PC linkup, etc. A hot item!<<<I own a 300SE and aside from the fact that it has updated firmware and more memory it is exactly the same.  I was worried about things that I had read stating that the case was shoddy, the volume level was insufficient  and the memory didn't hold enough.  I just wanted to say that all of this  IS NOT true.  It seems really solid to me, not that I'd ever drop the thing  or be rough with it, but it does just fine while jogging or riding a  bike...as for the volume level comments perhaps people are just listening  to songs encoded at a low base level because I listen to mine on level 5 of  20 and it's fine for most songs unless I'm in a REALLY noisy  environment...lastly I listen to all of my songs at 128k. and I can fit an  acceptable amount of music on my 64megs--no it isn't as much as a CD but  with 2 32meg smartmedia cards on the way that should be more than enough to  get me through all but the longest of plane flights.  With the portability  of the transfer cable and software I can just burn all of my mp3s to a Cd  or 2, throw it in my luggage and change the songs out from wherever I  happen to be...much more efficient than lugging around all of my CDR mixes  and other CDs.  True the parallel transfer is much slower than the USB that  the 500 offers, but do I really want to use USB when places that I travel  might not offer USB support?  Also the backlight of the new 500s are  supposed to drain the battery power and I don't find the lack of a  backlight to be as big of a problem as I thought it would be, however.  I  would definately recommend purchasing the rio remote as it super easy to  use and extends the headphone's cord length by a good 2 feet.  See ya!:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000JBAT

Ye>>>the_emperor_of_ice_cream>>>A. Jones "anjsmiles":::Because these speakers still hold up here in 2007 against some of the newest and most expensive computer setups.  I remember when these first came out and were the first set of computer speakers to ever get a "kickass" review from the computer enthusiast magazine "boot", but I didn't buy these myself until 2003 when they were on clearance for super cheap.Kinda wish I had bought more of them when they were so cheap, since they're STILL pretty much the best 2.1 computer speaker setup you can possibly have.  The midrange these put out is unbelievable for a speaker this size.They look a little outdated (I have the black color so slightly less so), but damn do these sound good-and I've owned and heard pretty much every "THX" certified 2.1, 4.1, and 5.1 computer speaker ever made.<<<I recently upgraded my stock Hewlett Packard Pavillion 9895 speakers to the Yamaha YSTMS50W 80-Watt 3-Piece Subwoofer/Satellite Computer Speakers.  First and foremost, let me tell you one thing: wow, and I really mean WOW, what a great set of computer speakers!Understand: you don't get full blown surround sound with these speakers -- few PC applications necessitate this type of audio quality anyway.  But unlike the higher end 5.1 and 6.1 speakers on the market today, these speakers will, out of the box, work with and optimize the performance of most stock sound cards.  And this is important if you want to get superior performance at a reasonable cost.My only complaint (and it is an exeedingly *small* one) is that the audio controls are split between one satellite speaker (volume and on/off) and the sub woofer (base volume) -- it would be more convenient to have all audio controls on one unit (i.e. on a satellite speaker).  But I can more than live with this almost negligible inconvenience to get the type of sound that these speakers deliver for the price.Net/net:1) Awesome (I would even say unsurpassed) sound quality to cost ratio2) Extremely easy set-up (took me less than 10 minutes -- and this included carrying the box up the stairs to my PC room)3) Wished the connecting wires were longer (the ones that came with my unit restrict satellite speaker placement to within 5 feet of the sub-woofer)4) Needs some industrial design tweaks (i.e. audio controls should all be in one place)5) Rich base, sweet high-ends, and earth shaking volume for you hard rockers or gamers6) MUST HAVE FOR ANY AUDIOPHILE WHO IS ON A BUDGET<<<Nice headphones. No noise escapes the headphones to disturb others.  Got them for my daughter's keyboard.  She says the only negative is that they don't have much range of volume but still great for when you want to play  when others are trying to sleep or whatever.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000JBHE

Mitchell>>>J. Burke>>>Michael J. Edelman:::It is absolutely useless.  The pictures are grainy, blurry, and have color aberrations galore.  You can't even see facial features on people.  It is not a true 640x480 camera; it uses software to obtain the 640x480 advertised resolution.  Downloads are horribly slow, and the memory is not removeable, so you can't use a better download method.  It will drain the batteries with only one loading and unloading of the 2MB memory.  This thing is not even useful as a toy for your children.  Fortunately I bought from a reputable online dealer who took the thing back, and even refunded all shipping charges.  Do yourself a favor and get an Olympus D-360L or D-460Z.  ...a lot more money, but about the least you can pay for a digital camera that takes decent pictures.DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!<<<I bought two of these for my kids and they are awful. The picture quality is so low that only about 10% of the photos are worth keeping. And being for my young children, my standards are very low. I bought them almost as a toy, and STILL I'm severely disappointed. DO NOT BUY.<<<I bought the Smile to have a handy, inexpensive way of addingphtos to web pages. I didn't want to spend $400 on a camera that wouldbe obsolete in a few months. I figured for $100 I couldn't go wrong. I was mistaken.The Smile just has too many compromises. The lens is a tiny fixed-focus item that requires bright light to form an image. Battery life is abysmal- it seems to chew up a pair of AAs shooting a dozen pictures.

Lauterbach "chadl2">>>Larry F. Rogers:::These speakers stunned me. When my tiny &quot;came with the PC&quot; speakers died, I looked into getting some similar little speakers, but then realized that I could spend just a few dollars more for this three speaker set.First, let me say that the subwoofer BOOOMS! The bass from the compact cube is deeper and more throbbing than my full stereo system. Really remarkable. I used this system in my dorm room at Columbia University this summer, and all my dorm mates were so amazed that the speakers were frequently borrowed for watching DVDs, and one classmate was so impressed that she bought her own set immediately a day after borrowing mine. With the massive BOOOOM of the system, it was easy to see why everyone was so enthusiastic.My only complaint, in fact, is that BOOM! The subwoofer doesn't have an independent volume control, so if I turn up the volume on the little speakers, the subwoofer follows right along, thunderously loud. A separate volume control on the subwoofer would have made this speaker set perfect.<<<This speakers are great sounding little things for the computer.  If you are looking for a set of speakers with a subwoofer this is definately not a bad place to start.  I have two sets of them and have had no problems with them, and yes... They are loud.<<<These speakers do not sound bad, don't get me wrong.  If the company had actually used a tad more thought when designing the cabling they would have a winner.  However, even the sound quality on these is not up to par with the set of Cambridge Soundworks/Creative Labs computer speakers I have that cost about the same price.The sub-woofer seems fine, but the satellites seem to have a much cheaper tinnier sound than the Creative Labs Speakers.  For gaming they sound fine, but music clearly sounds better on the Creative Labs speakers to me.But where these speakers truly fail the end user is in the wiring.  Unlike the Creative Labs set that is configured more like a standard set of stereo speakers, allowing you to position your satellites anywhere in the room to achieve optimal separation, the Altec Lansing set has very short cables.  The left speaker has to be within four feet of the subwoofer.  Then the right speaker has to be within six feet of the left.  Then to add insult to injury, the five foot wire from the computer to the speaker system has to plug into the left speaker.Worst of all, they hard-wire everything.  On the Creative labs system, the computer connects to the subwoofer which connects via standard speaker cable to the satellites.  Wonderful and simple design!!  The Altec Lansings have wires of non-standard configuration hard-wired into the left speaker and chincy speaker wire that is hard-wired between the speakers (Maybe if you rip them apart and splice wires you could expand it, but do you want to?).The easy configuration of your computer speaker system is a large percentage of its sound and convenience.  Dump these babies for the better sounding Creative Labs setup.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000JBJQ

Catalano:::Not many things you can buy for $10 anymore.. but this is definitely worth the small investment.The headset is comfortable, has a good microphone/earpiece and is almost unnoticeable after a few minutes of use.  Make sure you have a phone with a good belt clip that isn't too heavy to carry around.  The only downside to the headset is that there is no volume control and no mute button, so it's best to get a phone that has these functions in the phone itself.  I use it with a couple of different cordless phones and it performs flawlessly with both.<<<I was very disappointed with this product.As one other reviewer said the stem is too short.  So others can hardly hear me.  Obviously, if they can hardly hear me then what good is the product?  For instance, ever try getting a flight itinerary straight when the other person can hardly hear you?  (And I'm short myself, so it's definitely  not a matter of my having oversized head/mouth dimensions.)But, even when I took off the headset and held the mike right near my mouth and at other positions the sound was described as muffled and somewhat low, though without background noise.I also found the headset somewhat uncomfortable and difficult to put on at the moment.  I don't have a need to wear one all the time, but just for certain calls.  I often found myself fumbling to get it on.  I think I'll try an over-the-head model next.<<<The mike wand is only 4 1/2 inches long.  Since I have 7 inches between my ear and mouth the mike did not get close enough and my voice was too low.

Logitech TrackMan Marble FX Trackball:::B00000JBUI:::Computers & Accessories:::As Is. It may not work with new versions of Windows.

A new MSTE one will set you back hundreds; they're scarce.*Amazon says they first stocked this in 1973? What is that, 22 years before Amazon launched? Wasn't the web called ARPANET then?<<<This mouse has served me well for the past 10 years, and I hope it lasts another 10!  It's ergonomic, it doesn't need to be cleaned very often, it's very precise (far more precise than the thumb-balls Logitech currently sells), it has four buttons assignable to just about any function... superior in every way.Recently I tried to buy another one for work but couldn't find anything like it.  If you can find one, buy it!  ...and make sure to register it so Logitech realizes it's still popular!<<<I have two of these, one I just bought (used-mint condition) and one I bought new several years ago which is now dead.  People who do computer-aided design and need fine cursor control absolutely love the FX because the large ball gives you just that - better fine control than any other mouse or trackball.  However, some actions, like drag and drop, are difficult to do with the traditional left button and ball, and instead require the use of the 3rd button as a drag lock, which is easy to do, but different than you may be used to -- once you get the hang of it, it becomes second nature.  The fourth button can be programmed for scrolling.  The buttons are programmable - you can choose what function you want them to perform.The hand placement over the curvaceous FX body is also very comfortable and even relaxing - once you get used to it, and don't try to drag and drop with the left button and ball.  You can use both your thumb and one or even two or three fingers to move the ball around without ever tiring or straining.The downside of this model is that Logitech has abandoned it due to a patent infringement suit, and no parts are available for repairs, and no one I know repairs them.  To get a part, you must cannibalize another Trackman Marble FX, and the cannibalized parts will already be used and aged with a short life span -- assuming you can get a used one with still usable components.  There are no new FX's anywhere.Another downside is that the FX only came with either a serial port or a PS/2 connector.  There are no USB or wireless versions.  And every attempt to utilize a USB adapter results in some functionality being lost.  The serial port has long gone the way of the Dodo bird, and PS/2 ports are non-existent on new model computers.  In another 5 years the FX will be largely obsolete and incompatible.  This has already affected the going price.  Whereas a couple of years ago, even a poor-condition FX commanded a steep price, a mint-condition FX now command less than $100 (I won my minty for only $82 just yesterday as I write this). Yes, there are vendors still listing FX's near $300, but they aren't getting many takers, if any.The bottom line for this once very superior design is that apart from a few fanatics (like myself) who have yet to upgrade to a new USB-only PC (or Mac) the FX is dated, and soon will be obsolete and incompatible with the new equipment coming out.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000JBUI

Before I got it I would throw garbage on the backseat floor and clear out every couple weeks, which made for a cluttered gross back seat floor. This handles that pretty well. Couple cons though, it is smaller than the picture might indicate so it fills up rather quickly (make sure to check out the dimensions), and it is not always easy to empty out.  The velcro does hold the bottom closed very well, just if it is really full, you might have to reach in and pull stuff out when you empty it.  This is still much better than grabbing the crap off the floor, and I am very happy with the purchase.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000JD3O

Made a great gift. Great price,fast delivery.<<<I was expecting the G2000A to be much better made than it appears to be.  The case is plastic, and not particularly good plastic at that.  The seams between the front and back halves of the case don't fit together well, leaving an unpleasant sharp edge.  The leather cover is nice, and, unlike the plastic case, gives the radio the feel of an item that apparently once sold for $180, or there abouts.I bought the radio thinking it would be an excellent travel alarm/radio.  However, in reality it's much larger and heavier than I expected.The above criticisms all pale into insignificance compared to the reception and sound quality.  Both are extremely poor.  This radio can only lock onto the strongest of stations, and even then there is a fair amount of accompanying 'hiss'.  I don't live in an area with great radio reception; however, my Boston Acoustics Receptor radio has no problem tuning into most stations.  If the Grundig scans the fm band it only finds a grand total of 3 stations.  Short wave is basically worthless on this radio (as is the AM band).For $40 this radio is not a particularly good buy.  There are much better radios for the same price, or significantly less.  The leather cover adds a bit of uniqueness.  In its absence, this radio would be worth $20, at the very most.Bottom line - This radio looks really nice in photos, but dissapoints in reality (both in terms of fit and finish, and tuner quality).<<<The Grundig G2000A is like the pre-TV series Anna Nicole Smith:  hot looks, feels great, but not something you want to have around day in and day out.To be sure, it's one of the nicest-looking radios you'll find, but as a shortwave receiver, it lacks a lot:  doesn't tune the whole SW spectrum (why these radios just don't cover the full 1.7- 30 MHz range is beyond me) sensitivity leaves a lot to be desired, and selectivity (ability to separate closely-spaced stations) is in adequate.  Plus, the audio is on the tinny side.  For the $80 or so bucks you will normally pay for this, you can do much better.  Probably Grundig's worst model.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000JD4T

The YB400PE does it all; pulls in AM/FM-stereo and Shortwave, with continuous tuning from 1711-29,995 KHz. SSB circuitry allows for reception of Single Sideband two-way communications such as amateur radio (HAM radio).				    						:::https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51G6W03CDBL._SX200_.jpg:::Dan "toujoursdan">>>D. J. Stone>>>Drive-In-Freak:::This, along with the Sony ICF-7600G are among the two best portable shortwave radios offered by Amazon at this time. Both have their advantages and it is up to the user what is most important. The Grundig YB-400 is a  fairly easy to use radio that allows the user to punch in the desired  frequency, enter it into one of 40 memories, or scan desired bands to find  a station of interest. The Grundig's best asset is its great audio. It is  definitely the best audio I've heard from a shortwave portable and makes  listening a real pleasure. If you live or travel to any part of the world  other than Europe or eastern North America the Grundig YB-400 is the best  you can buy. If you live in one of those two places consider the Sony,  which has a synch. detector that allows you to reduce interference from  adjacent stations. This is important in areas where there are a high number  of strong stations crowded next to one another. In any case, both are well  worth the money.<<<I've been collecting radios for a couple of years now, and own over 75 (at last count).  They range from old tube-type AM table radios to early transistors to the latest and greatest.  Let me tell you what I think about the Grundig YB400-PE:Strong points:1)  Solid-feeling quality.  It doesn't feel cheap when you pick it up.2)  Good sensitivity across all bands.3)  Nice, full sound from the internal speaker.4)  Accessory package includes a good quality soft case, AC adaptor, bud-type earphones, and 23' compact SW antenna5)  The ability to switch tuning increments to help fine tune in a hard-to-tune station.Not-so-strong points:1)  Only 40 presets.  I don't need 200, but it would be nice to be able to separate them into "folders" for AM, FM, SW.2)  Battery life is acceptable, but definitely not exceptional.  I usually plug in the AC adaptor because of this.3)  I wish it had a rotary tuning and tone (bass/treble) knobs.  Why?  I just like them.4)  The backlight is very weak -- a poor choice of LED'sI know a lot of people find SSB reception to be important, but I rarely use it.  As often as not, I like to just tune around the SW bands at night and see what I can find.  Sure is interesting to hear the viewpoint that other parts of the world have about the US.I'm a radio fan, not a radio geek.  I just like to play around with radios that are easy and fun to use and sound good.  If you're like me, I'll bet you'll like this radio.  If you're a geek, you may have more bones to pick with it, but on that I really cannot comment.<<<The good stuff:-BFO for SSB-will tune in 1 KHz steps-very very good sound through phones( if you have good ones)-very good sound with built in speaker-FM stereo through phones-very good FM-good AM/MW-good SW with whip ant.-handy reel ant.-very good owner's manual with frequency guide for ameteur,aironautical,and maritime.-nice case-built very well with good quality feel to it.Things that bug me,but not too much:-Bass and Treble would be nice,but if not CAN'T WE AT LEAST HAVE A TONE KNOB? Not even the famed Sony 2010 has one! Why not? The hi/low switch is better than nothing,and does an ok job.-No rf gain control.Two way dx/local switch only-no tune knob just up and down buttons,so it's a bit of a pain to band scan.Push push push push push push push.Can tune in 1 KHz steps.-BFO only. No usb/lsb.Tunes in 1 Khz steps with bfo "fine tune" knob.Still ok for ssb ,just could be better.-no sync detector.Hay,what do 'ya want for that price ?-Cheezy "earbud phones". Then again, did you ever get a decent pair of headphones with anything? Not me.Spend a little and get some Koss "Porta-pro" phones.You will never go back to cheap ones again!-dial light only stays on for 10 sec.Don't let all of this talk you out of one though.What it does it does well....All in all: A fine little radio esp. for the $. Quite good sound with the speaker,and very very good through phones.Good MW/Am dx( not a 2010 or RF-2200 but,still a lot better than you might think).Good with just the whip ant. for SW.Very good FM.I think it's by far the best radio you can get for the money....grab one while you can still get a new one....8):::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000JD4V

Thomas "Joey":::Bought the camera mid-June, and by late June was covering a national convention requiring daily uploads to webpages.  Got rave reviews of the images shared.  The USB connection is easy and fast.  I found it handled  indoor shots without flash with outstanding resolution.It has also  produced some excellent outdoor shots, including some sky photography  (sunsets) that rival film versions.One does not need to employ the top  setting to produce extremely good pictures, maximizing the number of photos  on a single compact flash card.It came complete with a set of  rechargable batteries and charger - a nice feature.  And the Amazon price  is at least $100 less than any other source!This would be a perfect  camera for a person just starting into digital photography, who wants a  camera that looks, feels,  and acts like a familiar 35 mm point and shoot  and who has elementary knowledge and sense of computers.<<<This was my first and only digital camera that I purchased as a display item will I was working at CompUSA. If I remember correctly, at the time this camera was over $300 but I got it for $50.I have no idea how old this camera was when I bought it, but despite that, it lasted an additional 3 1/2 years before it stopped working; the battery connections went bad. I took it apart to see if I could fix it, but to no avail.The 1.3 Megapixels was more than sufficent for me, it took crystal clear pictures everytime. I really enjoyed the LCD screen that showed in real time what the lens was looking at before you shot the picture. It also had a USB slot where you could easily tranfer the pictures to your PC. My only compaint about the camera was that the picture snapping was not instantaneous.This camera felt sturdy and built with quality materials. This camera had been dropped a few times, but it still functioned without any problems. I have taken thousands of pictures on this camera, not to mention the possible thousands that were taken before I came to own it, and I have been thourghly suprised with the durablity and quality of this camera.After my DC240 finally met its demise, I was dissapointed to find that Kodak no longer made cameras like this, instead they make these plastic, cheap looking, cheap feeling cameras that feel no way as sturdy as the DC series. I purchased a DX model a few months after this one died and took it back the next day because I was very dissapointed in the quality of the camera. To this day the DC240 has been my only digital camera and I haven't had one since. I will have to turn to EBAY to get something from the DC series, because unfortunately companies no longer make them like they used to.<<<I really like mine. It takes good pictures. It was easy to get started with it. Do not try to buy a small camera bag for it because the lens cover will come off easily and you may accidentally turn it on when putting it into its bag.  I highly recommend the USB disk reader, makes things a lot easier. With that reader you may not need the battary charger unless you want a slide show on your TV. Note that the Kodak 280 is offered here... [it] is probably more value. But, you will have to buy accessories so [it] will become a bit more after its all done. I can't say too much about how the pics print because I have been using it exclusively for Internet images. I am having fun with mine.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000JDEL

Five stars.<<<Belkin is a classy company indeed. I am frequently plugging and unplugging my laptop from this cable and the tab that keeps the wire in the R-45 jack broke off after about 6 months of heavy use. Went to their website, put a claim in and they mailed me out a new one the next day, no questions asked. Sweet.UPDATE 8/08 Belkin now makes a50FT CAT6 Black Patch Cable Snagless RJ45M/RJ45Mthat is better made, transmits data faster and supports 1000 MBps networks and probably best of all is cheaper.<<<I bought these Belkin cables. They are very nice quality. They seem heftier than a lot of the other cables. My system analyst neighbor mentioned that he prefers to buy the 1000 foot roll. He runs them to wall outlets, then uses the 7 foot or 14 foot snap in cable from the wall to the PC. That way, you don't have to buy a 40 dollar crimping tool.You can't solder these cables. They require a metal to metal contact, and lead-solder doesn't qualify. Also, it is critical to keep them spiraled, all the way up to the end. Even when attaching, instructions call for twisting them right up to the connection.Since the tech instructions, tell you to keep them down to under 350 feet, these cables, whether they are long or short, are in the right lengths.I know Amazon doesn't print prices in their reviews, but they have the local major chain office supply stores beat hands down. The 50 foot roll was half again as much locally.These are the Category 5e cables. They give you a better return feed, which results in better overall performance. So insist on 5e instead of just 5. I initially bought some wall plates from Radio Shack that were Category 3, then I returned those for the snap in option Category 5. Those were returned also, when I went to Home Depot (of all places to go networking) and they had the complete Leviton line of 5e accessories.If I had to do it over again, I would still buy the Belkin 50 footers. I don't want to have a 500 foot roll of ethernet cable hanging around.These are tops. Gold plated connectors, Snag free ends, that protect that little lock in tab on the ends. You know the frustration of unsnarling a phone wire, out of a wiring mess, and the little tab bends over backwards, never to work properly again. Well Belkin built twin arches over the sides to prevent just that. Way to go. Highly recommended, good stuff, for a good price.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000JDF6

Creative Labs CSW100 PCWorks 3-Piece Computer Speakers:::B00000JDGQ:::Computers & Accessories:::PCWorks has been carefully fine-tuned by Henry Kloss to produce the type of sound normally associated with high-quality stereo systems. Plug it into a portable CD player, computer, TV, clock radio, or boom-box for rich, beautiful sound. And because it works on 12 volts, it's perfect for boats, campers, and cars. PCWorks consists of two very small speaker cubes plus a compact subwoofer. It contains a 3-channel amplifier that's been precisely tailored to match the speaker drivers. Its input panel includes a "set and forget" bass control, terminals for the satellite speakers, and a stereo mini-jack input. The system includes an in-line volume control that can be placed where it's easy to reach. PCWorks takes up very little space. Its compact, shielded satellites fit just about anywhere. Use their supplied stands and place them on your work surface, or attach them to the wall with the supplied Velcro kit. The subwoofer has a minimal footprint, so you can place it on the floor, out of the way, or out of sight.				    						::::::alaska>>>Amazon Customer>>>"holiveira":::Pros: low price, decent sound, unobtrusive, easy to set up.  Unlike some 3 or 5-piece systems, the PC Works bass unit is shielded, in case you ever need to put it close to your monitor.Cons: though it seems a bit silly  to complain that a $50 set of speakers offers less than perfect sound  reproduction -- heck, I've spent far more than that on speaker wire -- the  &quot;subwoofer&quot; in this set is not really a subwoofer at all.  It's a  woofer, and exhibits a rather uneven frequency response.  Still, the sound  is fine for games and most Internet music content.As long as you  aren't expecting them to sound like a good pair of living room speakers --  don't believe the hype on the box -- you probably won't be disappointed.<<<I have been using it on my PC for 2 years now. This made-in-China product proved to be very reliable.  It sounds great with games and CD audio.  It sounds A LOT better than those mini 2 speakers. For just $40, I don't see why we should use the cheapy mini speakers.  My only complain is the volume distortion.  If I push the volume higher than 5 using the build-in volume control, the speakers starts to have some background noise.<<<Excellent speaker system for the price. Extraordinary sound, and great Bass.

Dazzle Multimedia DM4100 Digital Video Creator:::B00000JF4M:::Computers & Accessories:::The Dazzle Digital Video Creator allows personal and business computer users to easily capture, edit, manage, publish, and share full-motion TV quality video, CD quality audio, and high resolution still images.				    						:::https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/516RRJCF5NL._SX200_.jpg:::Laurence "Laurence">>>LM>>>Thomas Lunsford "Computer Engineer":::The USB version of the Dazzle DM4100 video capture box is an excellent way to capture video into the MPEG1 format in real time.  This format plays back well on modern PC and Mac computers but doesn't take up too much hard drive space.  The quality isn't as good as a professional encoder but then  it costs about a tenth of the price.<<<First time I plugged it in and installed the drivers it worked instantly. Captured about four hours worth of high quality video with no sync problems on a P3-450 with 128megs ram.I then installed a USB cd writer. The  Dazzle device no longer works. I really don't care what installing the cd  writer did, I see this as a major flaw. My USB cd writer and USB zip drive  work perfectly. I'm now forced to use this device on another, much slower  computer. Nothing about this is mentioned on their site.This product is  VERY flakey. After making changes to video settings, you must exit the  program, unplug the device, plug it back in, and restart the capture  program. This seems to be Dazzle's solution for every problem I've  encountered with this piece of uhm.. plastic.It feels as if this product  was rushed out in a &quot;just make it work&quot; strategy. Dazzle  obviously did not test this product thoroughly enough before finalizing  it.Stay away. Get a digital camcorder and DV card instead.<<<If you want a small, low resolution image that has unsynchronized audio (or you have forever to wait on the audio sync), this one is for you!  Oh, yea, don't expect to be able to videoconference with your camcorder.If  you want to capture home videos with no or low loss of quality and want it  done at a reasonable speed, you probably don't want this one (or any other  USB or similarly slow external connection).:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000JF4M

Petit>>>Howdy:::After reading every review we could find, we ventured for the first time into the digital photographic world purchasing the Olympus 340-R digital camera.  We were definitely not disappointed.After just a few days the  camera accompanied us to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia and Seoul, S. Korea, while  we nervously left our Canon SLR at home.  The camera performed marvelously.  We found the optional 16MB flash memory card more than adequate for our  needs, as we easily downloaded photos each day into our laptop.We were  amazed at the quality of photos even in low light settings.  We took shots  at our conference including a multimedia presentation where surprisingly  the projected image on the screen was readable!  While staying in the  countryside in a traditional Mongolian &quot;ger&quot; (tent), we shot an  incredible photo of the predawn sky-- even the morning stars are clearly  distinguishable!Arriving home we were completely satisfied with the  photos shot at the low resolution setting when printed out on our HP  Deskjet 895 using an Epson photographic paper.  I doubt that most people  would be able to tell the difference between the prints and a standard  developed snapshot.  The enclosed Olympus and Adobe software is easy to use  and functional for most home use.  You will absolutely love the Quickstitch  utility that simply creates oversized and panorama shots!One of the only  weaknesses we found a little frustrating was the variance between the  optical viewfinder and the digital one.  If you frame... say, a head and  shoulders shot in the optical viewfinder, you will discover that digitally  the camera sees a much broader area.  Olympus should do a little better job  calibrating the two viewfinders.Apart from that, you will want to invest  in the NiMH charger and at least 8 batteries-- shop around for the best  price.  Also, picking up a 3.5 inch floppy adapter for the flash memory  card will be a big time saver. You simply pull out the flash memory card,  slip it into the adapter, and then slide the floppy into any computer.  You'll save time and frustration over having cords laying all around your  table, plus a significant download time.One last item-- Do you think a  16MB memory card will be too small for your needs?  Olympus, through their  website, is offering an inexpensive upgrade through the end of December  that will allow the camera to use the new 32MB memory cards.<<<The Olympus D-340R is, in my opinion, the best value digital camera available right now.The picture quality is impressive---I usually can't tell the difference between the pictures it takes and pictures taken  with a $340 SLR that I have scanned in.Also, the camera is fairly  lightweight and compact and easy to use, like a good point and shoot camera  should be.Since I bought my Olympus, I have not taken 1 non-digital  photograph.  I enjoy the simplicity of the camera and the freedom from  developing and film costs (some $10/roll).Overall, the camera is worth  the investment and it is an excellent camera for someone new to digital  photography.<<<I have owned an Olympus 340 for two years and I've been very happy with it...but I recently upgrade to the Olympus 3040 because the 340 just couldn't give me the print-quality I was looking for!  Frame a photo from the 340 and you can tell it is a digital photo.  Frame a photo from the 3040 and you would never know it was digital!  So, I love this camera and it was a great camera for me to learn about digital photography and to see if I liked a digital camera more than my old 35mm.  But, two years later, I've found the need to upgrade.  However, due to the significant price jump, the comparisons to the 3040 are not totally fair!  So I still give the 340 a rating of 5 stars because for the price I think it is a great option!:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000JFIF

I travel frequently and the L50 keeps me company in the airport lounge and on the Airplane. The folks that make the PowerXtender laptop adapters for airplanes are going to be shipping one for  the L50 so you won't need to take extra batteries on those long flights.  The screen is very nice looking, and the 16x9 format lets you view  anamorphic format DVDs in their best possible resolution. Of course, the  wide screen also causes you to curse the DVDs that AREN't anamorphic (e.g.,  Titanic). The sound from the built-in speakers is ok, but sounds very good  from a pair of headphones. For travelers I recommend a pair of the Sony  Noise Cancelling Ear Buds.<<<Hey, this is by far the biggest step up in portable tube-vision that will ever happen.  Great picture and sound quality comes from the 2 speakers.  The only thing that you might want to think about here is the battery life!  This was a major frustration in trying to watch any movie more than 2  hours long since the battery life is approximately two hours.  This was  pretty good however, and the battery life doesn't hurt the rating for me  since I got the power adapter!:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000JFMK

It charges both NiMH and NiCd batteries in all sizes AA,AAA,C,D& 9 volt.  A full charge takes about six hours.  You can charge different sizes at the same time.  I consider this charger a very good investment and recommend it to all.<<<The only reason that I use this charger is in case I have a battery that is too dead to charge with my wonderful Maha MH-C801D charger.  Unfortunately the Maha MH-C801D needs some slight residual charge remaining for the processor to initiate a charge, so that is why I sometimes need to use this Energizer CHM4FC for around a half a minute to give the battery just enough juice for the Maha MH-C801D to initiate a charge.  The Energizer CHM4FC does not care how dead a battery is, but it does a poor job of charging compared to the my Maha which uses pulsed charging.  The Maha can even erase the memory effect of old batteries.  At least the Energizer CHM4FC does not burn up the batteries like those terrible life shortening 15 minute chargers however.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000JGNB
PalmOne HotSync Cable for Palm VII &amp; III:::B00000JHVP:::Office Electronics:::Pack lightly! Take a HotSync(r) cable along when you travel, instead of a cradle.

Levine:::I have to agree with other users that this is a great product, BUT it's not as practical as you may think. A USB sync cable is a better idea. Talk about convenience. Secondly, the cable is too long! Who needs 3' (or 2') or cable to connect a Palm to a Laptop  computer? The reason why I'm writing this review is because I haven't been able to find a USB sync cable. I called Palm, there is none available. I visited the stores, there is none available. Will anybody have the brilliant (and obvious) idea of creating this device?! I also write this review for those of us who use laptop computers with USB ports and don't want anything to do with legacy hardware.<<<Don't travel with the cradle, and don't wait until you return from a trip to synch with your laptop.  Just roll up one of these and stick it in your laptop case.  This is especially useful for Palm VIIs, which can't use the  version of PalmOS that supports synching through the IR port.This cable  does not have a synchronize button. In order to use it, connect the cable,  turn on your Palm, press the HotSynch icon, and press the LocalSynch icon.Remember that leaving your Palm in the cradle or leaving this cable  connected to both your Palm and your computer will put an extra drain on  your batteries, so you should unhook your Palm as soon as you finish  synching.<<<If you're going to sync from more than one computer, this is a far better option than buying an additional cradle.  To offset the lack of the convenient button on the cradle, you get better portability, a lower cost, and can hook it up to Palms that live in a carrying case without having to rip it away from the velcro.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000JHVP

Rosen>>>Eric Antonow:::I received this DVD player yesterday 11/30/99 and my son tried to install it. He is not a genius at electronics. We called the Toshiba service 1-800 support line and were patiently assisted with the installation. This was  extremely helpful to us. This is easy to install but if you aren't an  electronic wiz, this is a very good asset. The DVD player itself seems  flawless to us at this point. I would recommend it highly.<<<I've had this player for about six months. About 15% of the DVDs that I own have at least one feature that can crash this player, when that happens  the only way to reboot it is to hit the switch disk button, none of the  other buttons will work. The remote control design is pathetic, half of the  buttons are hidden by a cover, and are virtually inaccessable. The skip and  fast forward functions are combined on a single key, to fast-forward you  must hold down the skip button for several seconds, if you don't hold it  down long enough it skips to the next scene. The skip backwards function  doesn't work, it can only return to the start of a scene, not an earlier  one. So if you accidently skip to the next scene you must restart the movie  from the beginning.<<<I can't find a compelling reason to recommend a higher priced model than this one. Sound and picture as rich as can be. It is worth hooking up to a stereo system if you have one near your television.Remote features are  excellent, allowing for more tricks than you'll use. Chose this after too  many negative reviews of low price Sony models (I'm sure everything is  fixed, but I wasn't going to take a chance over the holidays). Wasn't a  Toshiba fan before this purchase (simple Sony prejudice) but now I'm  willing to spend the big bucks on one of their large TV's. You'll enjoy  this player and its price.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000JHWX

Palm products have always been of the best quality, and the Palm V Hotsync Cradle is no exception. I purchased an extra cradle for use with another desktop, so I can sync with several computers.

A must buy for palm V(x) users that need to sync with another computer, or need one at the office and at home. Whatever the case maybe, its very handy to have an extra cradle around.<<<Didn't work for my device but it lit up and worked. I sent it back with no problem and a full refund.<<<It does what is advertised. Charges palm V and is also  downloads to pc. That I haven't been able to try as the plug on the end of the cable is female and the connection to my laptop is also female. Need an adapter.

Kodak Battery Charging Kit:::B00000JI38:::Camera & Photo:::Includes charger and 4 NiMH batteries				    						::::::D Darkman>>>hrbud>>>neurotome "neurotome":::... I bought these, and mine came with 1450 batteries. ...Another  note: It doesn't have an electric cord, just two plug-prongs that flip out  and go into a socket.  Makes it very compact, somewhat elegant.  BUT: its  design is such that (1) it doesn't work well in a horizontal outlet, only  in a vertical outlet, i.e. where the switch plate is a vertical rectangle.  In a horizontal outlet, the box ends up hanging precariously on its side,  prone to falling out of the wall.  (2) if you happen not to have the lower  outlet open, it doesn't sit readily in the upper outlet because it's upside  down so the weight of the batteries tends to pull it away from the wall.  So far it hasn't fallen out in this position, but it's probably gonna some  day.  Personally, I think a regular electric cord and plug would have been  better -- I suspect Kodak just wanted to save a few bucks, and calls it a  &quot;feature&quot;.  Other than that it's okay, but why did I really spend  this much money?  As long as it's UL listed, buy yourself a cheaper  recharger from a major brand name, and make sure it's intended for nimh  batteries if that's what you want.<<<For a slightly less price, you can get yourself a negative pulse charger.  A negative pulse charger strips away sulfate buildup and gas bubbles that basically ruins any rechargable batteries.Take a look at the Maha C210 charger or Radio Shack cat 23-422 pulse charger.  They're microprocessor controlled so that you can't overcharge your batteries.  With the C210 you can charge any type of battery ranging from 3V to 12V.<<<This kit comes with everything you need to 'go rechargable' with one of today's digital cameras.  I use it for my Nikon Coolpix and have noticed that one full charge of the 1450 mA batteries lasts 5-6 times as long as  the disposable alkaline batteries that came with the camera.  Full  recharging takes about 3 hours.  The plug on the back of the charger folds  up into the unit so you can slip it into your pocket or bag with no problem  and be rechargable anywhere!Overall, slightly more expensive than other  units out there, but worth it.  Be sure to get 1450 mA NiMH (nickel metal  hydride) batteries if you're going to buy extra batteries with it; you'll  find all kinds of uses for them (pager, penlight, handheld games, etc.):::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000JI38

I am able to pick up some really distant AM stations and I am also able to pick up many shortwave stations only using the small built in telescoping antenna that it has. Performance is not as good as my larger SW and ham radios that I own but all in all I rate it very good for it size and performance. This model is no longer being produced but you may be able to locate a used one that is in descent condition.<<<This is the only shirt pocket size shortwave radio worth buying. For this great price you get a pocket radio without any drift (meaning the station you listen to won't change to another station because of a loose or faulty dial), great stereo FM on headphones or ear buds (the buds that come with it are OK. Buy a better set and get ready for great sound), good AM reception, and Shortwave reception that is adequate for the big international broadcasts like BBC but poor for most everything else. The speaker is only good for talk radio. For music, this is a tinny and tiny speaker (about one inch wide). If you want a pocket radio that also gets BBC, Radio Canada, and Voice of America, this is the trick. Listen in on good earplugs and you will be happy with your purchase. It also has a good vinyl case. The radio looks sturdily built and will probably last for years.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000JMO4

Witt:::This radio is a great value in a PLL-digitally-tuned radio.  It is being phased out in favor of the Eton/Grundig E100.  These days there has been a trend for analog-tuned radios with digital frequency counters like the Grundig 350 field radio.  While these radios are easy to tune and bandscan, they do not have any memory presets and the tuning drifts after a few hours based on temperature and humidity.  The Grundig YB300PE, on the other hand, is a true digital radio and has 24 memories.  The memories are a boon for FM/AM listeners like me who like to "channel surf" during the long 12-minute commercial breaks on Howard Stern and the Don & Mike show.  The direct frequency input is unheard of at this price, especially for a Grundig.  Granted, this radio is no longer made in Taiwan but mainland China (the box actually says "QUALITY PRODUCT MADE IN CHINA" in big letters, possibly in response to the reviews it gets in the Passport to World Band Radio book).The extras that are included with this radio cost almost as much as the radio itself: a quality AC adapter that doesn't introduce that annoying 60 Hz hum, a reel antenna, a carrying case, earbuds, and a lanyard that is actually really handy (the radio is much smaller than you might imagine from the pictures).  It runs on 3 AA batteries for what seems like forever in FM, and only a little shorter when always in AM or shortwave (cheap off-brand AA batteries are included).I can't really say that the speaker is useful for those who want to hear music but those folks are better off with the YB400PE, the larger cousin of this unit, or even Sony ICF-SW7600G.  No single-sideband is available but if you're serious about something like that you won't be buying a radio at this price, anyway.Overall a good radio for AM and FM digital preset channel surfers like me and the occasional jaunt into shortwave.  A great clock radio for travelling, too.<<<My Grundig 300PE was a Christmas gift, 2009. One week later, it wouldn't turn on.(PLEASE NOTE THIS IS AN UPDATED REVIEW... MY FULL REVISION AND EXPLANATION IS FOUND BELOW, UNDER THE ASTRIX ...)I've installed new batteries and it won't work on the external power source either. The "light" works, but nothing else will power up.This is frustrating, and sadly Grundig when it was a product made in Germany, was an outstanding line of radios. Now that they are made in China, there is no reliability in the products.I'd suggest "buy at your own risk" and understand that this radio has a short shelf-life.The audio quality (while typical for a radio having a speaker this small) was GOOD. It had an easy time receiving a signal inside my home in a rural area, miles away from FM transmitters. My old Sony portable radio (which I purchased and took to Russia in 1989 in order to get shortwave broadcasts from the USA) finally died after 20 years. The Grundig (when it worked) never performed as well as my Sony (made in Japan)but I wasn't too disappointed with the performance of Shortwave listening on this tiny radio. The Sony would hold a station better and not drift as bad as the Grundig and the Sony had vastly superior audio, despite having a speaker about the same size as the Grundig.******* UPDATE.  This Grundig radio EASILY "dies" often after being powered off and left to sit idle for a few days. I thought a component had gone bad inside the radio and I was about to shoot a video to post on YouTube showing a hammer crushing the darned thing because it "died."  However, I have been able to get this radio to working again (on several occasions) by pulling the cover off where the batteries go and discovering on my own, that there is a very VERY tiny reset button under the batteries. It has to be reset with a toothpick or a paper clip. When I reset the radio, it's like it comes back from the dead and works. But that being said, resetting this little monster is a frequent chore.<<<This radio has very good sensitvity to FM, MW and Shortwave.  Its sensitivity is almost as good as my Grundig 400PE, but some of the other specs aren't quite as good which I would expect for a receiver that is  about half the price of the 400 PE.  Its power consuption is better than  the 400 PE too.  It's smaller size (than the 400 PE), very good designed,  easy to use controls, good sound quality along with an excellent read out  offers a good value.  I like this radio's abliliy to quickly get to the  frequency I am interested in.  This is a fine little radio--- four stars.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000JMRX

I had to add a comment after reading the other reviews.  I AM NOT ALONE!!  These errors have been a continual headache, and from what I see from the reviews, turning to Sony will be to no avail.  Ah well, Sony has lost a DVD customer.  I have the Wega which is a great picture so I'm not uniformly prejudiced against Sony products.  And the DVD player when it has worked has been great. But the hitches have increased in frequency until lately I simply get No disc error.  The reader scans back and forth for about 20 seconds until it gives up.  And I'm giving up, too.  I am very surprised that a lot of people have this same problem... points to a generalized issue which I hope Sony can take care of.<<<For anyone who wants to have total control over what you're DVD movies look and sound like, this is the unit for you. Although the picture and sound are stunning.  If you feel the need to make them even better, The 550  gives you virtualy unlimited control.  And it will save the settings for  two hundred discs.  Just pop the movie in and all your adjustments are  recalled.  But beware if you are moving to DVD after years with a VHS that  flashed 12:00, opt for a simpler player.  Otherwise, you will be paying for  a something that you can't control.  The Sony 330 will deliver fantastic  picture and sound, for $150 less.  And, as far as the sync problems that  many have reported, I have had the player for two weeks now and have had no  problems what so ever.  Even after checking out many of the reported  problem scenes listed in other reviews.  DVD is the future of home video.  Don't take my word, just look around yourself.  If you're ready to buy,  don't wait.  You won't regret it for a minute.<<<Sony Has Sure Come Up With Another Great Hit...This DVD Player Is The Only One You'll Ever Need To Buy...At This Price And With Features, You Can't Beat It...Below Are Features And Details For All Of Us Technical  Junkies...Alot Of These Specs Are Typical Of All DVD Players, But Sony Has  AVery Well Engineered Unit...If You're Not A Techie, Just Go And Get One At  Your Local A/V Store...

It has all the features I wanted, pretty good battery life, and is a perfect size.PROS:-Basic, easy to use interface.-Decent battery life, although not as long as the manufacturer claims.CONS:-I hate the software interface. It is slow, unstable and poorly designed. I suggest you use Windows Media Player instead to upload files to the device.-As of firmware version 2.15 (availible from ftp://ftp.s3.com/pub/multimedia/rio/rio500_firmware_215.exe), the player only supports additional smartmedia cards of up to 64mb, to give it 128mb of total memory. Although this is a decent amount, 128mb smartmedia cards have gotten a lot cheaper....-There is no Windows XP support with the included software. It will work with XP using 3rd party software, which, consequently, is better than the included software...<<<I still prefer my Rio 500 and have yet to &quot;upgrade&quot; to any of the newer MP3 players.  It is light, smaller than a deck of cards and easy to use.  I used it primarily to listen to Audible (audio books) while commuting and it has been flawless [with the exception that one time it refused to boot up properly, with a checkerboard screen].  A quick search at Rio's website (rioworld.org) revealed a recovery utility, which I ran and recovered my Rio's firmware.  Whew!<<<The Rio is overall a great product. The buttons and &quot;interface&quot; on the player itself are for the most part intuitive (though it took me some time to figure out the more &quot;advanced&quot; features) and are  easy to use, even when you're fumbling around in your pocket to change a  song.The fact that the player is unskipable (it's not like MiniDisc  where they SAY it doesn't skip and it really does) and extremely  lightweight makes the Rio the perfect exercise companion; I take it on  every run.For 99% of purposes, 64 megabytes memory is enough (unless  you're a fan of 256 kb encoding). I can almost always fit ten or more songs  on the player, and changing them is easy enough. So don't worry about the  memory size-it's enough.The software (I use a Macintosh) is well done  and makes it very easy to transfer songs to the player itself. The only  thing I was less than perfectly happy with was the wait while the songs  copy (in the scheme of things, a very small flaw). The USB interface was no  problem at all, even on an older, less compatible iMac (Revision A).The  headphones included with the player are neat looking, but not great  sounding. The fidelity is low, with barely any low and low-mid-range sound.  Assume you will have to spend at least another $25 for decent  ear-buds.The only feature I feel the Rio lacks is recording capabilities  like the Nomad. But again, no big deal.Overall, a great product. I'd buy  one for a friend.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000JSGF

Day>>>researcher>>>Roy Chan:::I got this JVC video tape player a long time ago and guess I paid about $100 for it back then. It's the only VCR we have now that still works and don't eat up VHS tapes. I got it because of the S/Video and I can play are old VHS tapes with S/Video to a DVD recorder S/Video input to save are old VHS tapes to DVD. With the way are other VCR's are not working and messing up VHS tapes it is very good to get them saved to DVD and this is about the best way using S/Video.-Raymond Day<<<I have no complaints. I love the picture quality. The picture quality is even further raised with features like VIDEO STABLIZER, VIDEO CALIBRATION, and you can change the sharp tone to "SHARP" for a sharp picture, "SOFT" for a smooth picture, and "AUTO" for use with VIDEO CALIBRATION. This VCR is the most reliable I have ever seen. Sometimes the picture quality is better that DVD recorders. Unlike DVD recorders, there are certain tapes that can record HDTV. Use that tape with its Super Video connection, and you will have a knock-out.When you hook up your antenna to the VCR, then from the VCR, to the T.V., you get a super clear picture. (For antenna users) It also has VCR plus, so you can connect it to your cable box and it will automatically record for you, A S-Video connection, HI-FI, and an MTS decoder.<<<Pros: Excellent value, great picture quality in S-VHS, jog/shuttle, S-Video in/outs, Easy setup, cables included, quality construction, lots of features, OK tracking, Super VHS ET mode, 400+ lines of resolution, Has 19u Heads For Taping In The Extended Mode, Can Record Super VHS On Standard Tapes, do I need to say more?!?!Cons: Tracking problems in EP mode, flimsy, some color problems, Super VHS tapes may be hard to find and expensive, the menu system is kind of complicated, Clunky remote, traditional programming procedure, Front Display PanelThe Bottom LineThe HR3600U is a bargain &#65533; the picture quality, S-VHS ability and features for $ are excellent.Highly Reccommended!!IntroductionMy reason for purchasing this VCR was simple. I wanted an inexpensive VCR with S-Video inputs. For those who may not know, S-Video inputs allow the transfer of 400 lines of resolution, as opposed to the usual 260 or so transmitted via RCA connections. In theory, the higher the resolution is the better the picture looks.FunctionalityIn addition to the VCR, there are a set of RCA cables and an S-Video cable included as well. Overall the unit is a piece of cake to setup. The unit has both RCA and S-Video jacks on the back, and a set of RCA jacks on the front. This makes it easy to hook up an external source (such as a camcorder or something) and record to VHS. I have my unit hooked up to my computer (it has a video card with S-Video out and RCA audio outs), and I haven&#65533;t actually used the input jacks on the front of the VCR. Another feature I really like is the simple 1-touch recording button on the unit. The way I have it set up, I can just reach up from my computer and hit it, and off it goes.This unit has a jog/shuttle wheel which is used to perform all the rewinds and fast forwards. I&#65533;ll have to say, this is my first experience with a shuttle wheel. I like it! It just seems more cool than a &#65533;rewind&#65533; or &#65533;fast forward&#65533; button. Lol The unit rewinds tapes faster than my old Zenith VCR.The clock is easy to set as well. I think this is an area which has been greatly improved upon in recent years. For that matter, all the menu items are laid out in a common sense manner, which makes programming and such even easier.I noticed some were saying they didn&#65533;t like the remote control, but I think it is just fine. Grant it, I don&#65533;t use it much, but the times I have used it, I haven&#65533;t encountered any problems with it.Two other things I really like are (1) Having a time code counter display on the LCD so you know how much you&#65533;ve recorded. (2) When you rewind, this little bar pops up on screen and shows you where you are relative to the length of the tape. It&#65533;s not really super useful, but I just like knowing where I&#65533;m at.Picture QualityI&#65533;ll have to say that for $, this unit produces great quality dubs in regular VHS mode. I&#65533;ve been using it for several months now, and the video productions I&#65533;ve produced always come out looking very good. And that&#65533;s the most important thing! I haven&#65533;t dubbed anything in S-VHS or S-VHS ET mode yet because none of my projects have warranted that. I would imagine that the picture quality would be even more outstanding than the regular VHS mode though.Nit PicksWhile the outer enclosure looks nice, the unit &#65533;feels- cheap. I don&#65533;t think it would hold up too well under any kind of rough conditions. Hopefully this VCR will reside either in your home theater or a setup like mine where it stays put and isn&#65533;t moved around too much.The cheesy &#65533;glow in the dark&#65533; keys on the keypad of the remote. I hate it when electronics manufacturer&#65533;s use these gimmicky things. They never work.ConclusionsFor the money, you just can&#65533;t beat this VCR. The ease of setup and great picture quality are this VCR&#65533;s strongest points. I highly recommend this VCR to anyone looking for a budget level VCR.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000JXV3
Sony MVC-FD73 0.3MP Mavica Digital Camera w/ 10x Optical Zoom:::B00000JYLO:::Camera & Photo:::2x high speed 3.5" floppy disc drive, disc can transfer images to your computer, 10x optical zoom lens, VGA resolution, progressive scan CCD, 2.5" color LCD w/brightness control, manual exposure, one charge takes up to 950 shots, includes lithium battery and charger				    						::::::Bernie Bernbaum>>>C. Manuelian "carlm">>>Deborah A. Woehr:::The Sony Mavica was my first color digital camera.  Although I took a lot of pictures with it, I eventually bought another digital camera.  The biggest problems with the Mavica are.1. The resolution - 640 by 480 just  isn't good enough.  If you do any photo editing at all, the quality suffers  because of the low resolution.  You need at least a 1200 by 800-1000  resolution, preferably more.2.  The LCD is too hard to use, especially  in strong light.  You really need a viewfinder.3.  The floppys just  don't store enough.  If you go on vacation, you need to carry a bunch of  extra floppies in your pocket.On the plus  side, the battery life and 10x zoom are great.  But that just doesn't make  up for the weaknesses mentioned  above.  Do your self a favor and get  camera with better resolution - and maybe you'll only have to buy one.P.S. I traded up to a Kodak DC260 and like it fine.<<<The Mavica MVC-73 is a good low end camera.  If I want to blow up my pictures to 16X20, I use my 35mm SLR.  Megapixel cameras do take better pictures but they require EXPENSIVE memory cards.  The camera takes great shots for web sites and email.  If you shop around, floppies cost almost nothing.  With a rebate, I bought 100 floppies.  I put 10 of them in a bag and I took over 200 photos. (It would have cost me hundreds of dollars to save that many pictures on memory cards.) They used up less room than two rolls of film.  The recharable battery lasts forever and I can go out and take hundreds of photos without having to dump the memory card.  Achiving the photos uses little disk space on my hard drive.  The camera is very easy to use and in the long run pays for itself on the savings on film development, batteries or extra memory.  I give copies of disks right on the spot and the camera is very reliable. If you are looking for a good &quot;snapshot&quot; camera, this is a good one.  The other reviews mention the good and bad points of the camera so there is no need to mention them again.  This is a great camera for real estate or onsite documentation and great for the 100000000 pictures of the baby or the family picnic.  It's a fun, simple and easy to use camera. How many pictures do you wind up enlarging?  I run my favorites on my screensaver and they look great.<<<This is my introduction to the digital camera.  So far, I'm very pleased with the results.  The Mavica is programmed with five picture formats: Fine, Sepia, B&amp;W, Negative Art, and Solarize.  It is easy to use, even for the beginner.  I disagree with some of the reviewers regarding its size.  I was able to shove it in my purse when I wasn't using it; however, for the price, I would've liked to see it come with an extra battery and a carrying case.  It does come with a shoulder strap, which isn't uncomfortable. The camera has zoom capability, but I found that you have to be careful with blurring.  I don't fault the camera, but the photographer.  I have had some experience with blurred pictures and red-eyes.  Photo-enhancing software such as PhotoShop will take care of that.  I know because I've tried. The Mavica works well with Macs and PCs.  The only problem I came across was sending the pictures after editing them with PhotoShop.  If your mother doesn't have the same software that you do, then you will have to send that blurry or red-eyed picture of Junior.  Oh, well. I like this camera, but if I win the lottery someday, I will go out and buy a CD camera because of the memory constraints that these floppy-based cameras have.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000JYLO

I took a closeup of a diseased mahonia  leaf, emailed it to my mom, and she diagnosed thrips and suggested  BT.This is a camera with more capability than I need, but the picture  quality and features are worth developing the patience to deal with the  online manual and learn.  I print pics on a HP722 and the prints look  great. (Tho the color degrades after a year. Printer ink problem, not  Camera)However, it has a few shortcomings. The paperless manual is a  pain when you are learning.  You just CANNOT see the lcd screen on the  camera in bright light which makes using the manual settings impossible.  The add on lenses (wide angle, etc) are awkward to use. I have lost more of  the tiny lens caps than I will confess.  I even dropped one on the grass  and was unable to find it right after dropping it.  I now have 6, having  asked everyone I know for one for presents.<<<I bought a Nikon Coolpix (my first digital camera) about a six months ago and am very satisfied with it.  Previously, I had owned a Nikon 35 MM &quot;point-and-shoot&quot; camera, but was interested in the advantages a  digital camera would provide;  immediate gratification through seeing your  pictures NOW, the ability to send JPG images to freinds and relatives, the  ability to delete pictures &quot;on-the-fly&quot;, etc.  What I got was a  mixed bag of results - mostly positive.Before I go any further, I must  advise you to get the following options:  two sets of rechargable NiMH  batteries which should be standard with the camera (I use the Kodak ones  available at Amazon.com), a higher-capacity memory card (I use a 128 MB San  Disk - Nikon's OEM), and some sort of adapter to transfer your images  quickly - the serial cable is just too slow.  I have purchased a SanDisk  adapter and insert the memory card directly into the PCMCIA slot on my  laptop computer for rapid transfer.Anyways, in use the camera is  fantastic.  Initially, I was using the 640X480 resolution setting to save  space, but with the new, larger card, I now use the 1600X1200 setting with  moderate compression for all pictures.  I find that the card can hold about  100 pictures at this resolution.  Once I find a picture I like, I use the  Microsoft Photo Editor software (comes with Office) and reduce the  resolution as appropriate (web pages, etc.).  I store my  &quot;keepers&quot; on CDROM at the higher resolution - you can always  reduce resolution and size.The picture quality is great.  The flash,  however, should only be used up to 10' - any further and your pictures come  out too dark.  Nikon USA has a web page with the latest firmware available  for download - which I recommend.Low points for the camera include the  fact that the lens resets to full zoom every time you turn the camera off!  I find myself zooming out every time I turn the camera on - this eats up  your batteries and takes time.  The flap that covers the memory card does  not always stay closed and flops open from time to time.  Sometimes, the  camera takes a while to reset between pictures, so a bit of spontaneity is  lost.There are now newer cameras out there.  I find that the 2.1  Megapixel capability of this camera meets my needs and that, given the  recent price reductions, I would buy this Nikon now if I were in the market  today.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000JYWQ

Picking black on white will keep you from having to worry that the dark color of the item you are labeling will hide the type on the label -- for that reason, I favor black on white over black on clear.- Certain items need a wider label to avoid curling and peeling off -- we found 1&#34; work best on 18-gallon storage totes -- 1/2&#34; just doesn't seem to have enough adhesive for the label to last over time.

Edelman:::The ETX-90EC has magnification of 48X; great for looking at the moon. However, if you want to look at any planets or stars, you _definitely_ need the optional eyepieces so you can have some control over magnification.  Without these optional eyepieces, you have no control over magnification.<<<I read all the reviews before buying ... and was a little worried that it might not meet expectations.  But it has worked out great.It was a thrill to see Saturns rings and view Jupiter.  The moon comes through bright and clear.  You can see other heavenly objects (even galaxies!) with it.  You won't see galaxies and nebula in the same detail as you do in books - but you'll see the dim shading of them in parts of the sky.It's compact and portable - so you can bring it to the beach, etc.  Our neighborhood is way to bright to use it for much night-sky viewing - so portability was a must.A scope that gave a better view, at the same price, would have been too big.  And a better portable would have cost too much.  This one was just right for us.  If price is not a problem, get a better portable scope.  If size is not a constraint, then spend less on a larger scope.  Otherwise, this one will do fine.MUST HAVE ADD ONS: A tripod (see my review there).  The computer controller (you'll NEVER find a lot of the night sky objects without one).  One or two good night sky books (to help you find cool objects like binary stars and galaxies).COMPLAINTS: It would be nice for this (and all scopes) to see some pictures of how night-sky objects will really look with it before buying.<<<The ETX is in many ways a marvelous little scope. Optically, it's far and above most 90mm catadioptric scopes, like the Celestron 90. Mechanically, though, it leaves a bit to be desired. There are a few too many flimsy  plastic parts, the clock drive is not terribly accurate, and the drive  clutch has way too much slop in it.The human engineering aspect leaves a  lot to be desired as well. The finder scope is almost impossible to use as  set up. The mount makes it impossible to view though the scope or finder in  many orientations.  What Meade tried to do here is create a clone of the  $4,000 Questar at a bargain price. Optically they've done well (though it  still falls short of a Questar) but in copying the mechnical design opf the  Questar they had to leave out precisely those details that make the Questar  such a pleasure to use.The $599 price is a little misleading. While  designed for tabaletop use, unless you have a cast concrete tabletop you'll  need a solid tripod to support it, so you can add another $150 right there,  bringing the actual cost to more like $749. And for that price there are a  lot of good choices around. They make not look as slick, but they're a lot  more usable.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000K3RI
Meade 497 Autostar Computer Controller for ETX Telescopes:::B00000K3RK:::Camera & Photo:::Turn any ETX EC into a complete computerized GO-TO system with over 30,000 object library				    						::::::C. McManis "Chuck McManis">>>Daniel W. Schuffert>>>DH:::The AstroStar is a great ETX accessory. My favorite feature is its &quot;give me a tour of what's good tonight.&quot; It is also great for figuring out what your looking at with its &quot;identify this&quot; feature. The only drawback is you have to be really careful aligning the scope initially to get it to work. The instructions weren't that clear between the scope, the tripod, and the Astrostar book. My recommendations to you, remember to align the scope to true north (i hold a compass on the lens tube), use a bubble level to level the tube, set your watch to the second on the nights you go out, and make sure the viewfinder and scope are well aligned. Do these four things and I guarantee you'll have a great night of viewing.<<<This controller really became valuable to me after the first 3 or 4 viewing sessions with my new ETX-90EC.  After the newness of just pointing the telescope at the brightest object in the sky wore off, the controller  assisted me with finding all kinds of new objects to look at. It took some  work for me to get the telescope aligned with the controller.  I had to  learn the reference stars that the controller uses to align the telescope.  Once I learned the reference stars, the unit becomes essential for me to  really enjoy this hobby.  I cannot imagine using my telescope without this  controller!<<<There are two schools of thought on the use of go-to telescopes.  One school believing that it takes away all the skill and fun from astronomy.  however, I'm a believer in the other viewpoint.  I think go-to capability opens up astronomy to the masses and brings the universe just that little bit closer to everyone.  I purchased the Autostar for my ETX about a year ago and it has had extensive use.  Out of the many many times I have used the autostar with the scope, I estimate it has performed as desired on 90% of my viewing nights.  Unusually, I seem to be able to align my ETX rather easily depsite the fact that many people have difficulty.  I think I have had luck on my side as the ETX, while a beautiful scope, can be a little temperamental.  Even after doing a quick and rough alignment, like pointing it in the general direction of due North, without using a compass, I still get very accurate results with the autostar.  I even changed locations the other day, moving from Auckland to Taupo, (some 3 hrs travel distance by car) and inadvertantly used the Auckland co-ordinates while viewing in Taupo.  Suprisingly after alignment, I still got accurate positioning from the autostar.  Once you get the hang of the menu system the autostar is really quite simple to navigate around.  The amount of data is staggering, but given the size of the playground, it's not suprising.  The unit itself is comfortable to hold and the adjustable brightness makes reading the screen simple in the dark.  I havn't found the built in red light at the top of the unit very good as it is just too dim to make out charts etc.  The trusty old torchlight with red nail polish on the lens is hard to beat on that score.  I suggest that if you are operating from a tripod, you attach something to the back of your autostar that lets you hang it up on the tripod when you are not using it. Otherwise it can dangle around and get in the way.  On a couple of occassions I have had the unit fail to operate correctly or reset itself. These have been far and few between, and readily fixed itself.  Ultimately the Autostar is a computer so an occasional reset is not entirely unexpected.  One minor problem I am experiencing at the moment is the scrolling text on the lower line of the display panel is tending to fade a little the faster it scrolls.  This has occured since I started using a power adapter for the scope so this will need investigating. This however is only a minor niggle. If you have any concerns about your Autostar consultthe best resource on the net for the autostar, Mike Weasners site. The Autostar is highly recommended and really an essential purchase to go along with your ETX. Clear skies everyone and happy alignments.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000K3RK

I'm headed to help coordinate a conference TOMORROW, so I ordered this lock to protect my laptop. I didn't want a combination lock because I've had those get all mixed up & unusable (thankfully not while connected to my laptop!)Sadly, this lock does not fit the new MBPro. I can't even get the lock into the Kensington slot, PLUS the metal stubs scraped up the surrounding area on my brand new comp! The scrapes aren't a *huge* deal, but I'm sad, given I've only had the comp a couple weeks.Now I'm headed off to Target in hopes of finding something. I'm just sad about the ridiculous price I'm gonna have to pay. If there's something I'm missing, I'd love to hear about it!Here's the UPDATE:After I had no success finding a lock at Target (Best Buy was closed), I came home & worked the lock some more. I finally got it to work, but I'm not sure what I did any differently: I lined up the Tbar with the stubs, put it in the slot, & turned the key to the left.

I can't believe they charge this much for something so lame.Don't waste your money.<<<I did my homework, and though I knew this trackball was mechanical and rather an old model, I still thought that overall many people had been happy with it.  I have used trackballs before to a limited extent, and my husband has the Kensington Optical Trackball with the cool red glow, but I wanted something that would better match my Mac.  Well, forget about that. The Orbit got very difficult to manipulate very soon after use...I had cleaned it several times in the first week, and I am a clean freak where the area around my Mac is concerned.  I found that the tiny springs inside were very fragile and one was not really in the right place. After two weeks I sent this back to AMAZON.  It is pretty, it SHOULD work better, but after thinking it over I ditched "matching", went out to Staples and tried the Logitech Marble Mouse. It is a great fit for my hand, and now resides on my desk.  The marble mouse is cheaper too, which is odd.  If I hadn't wanted a trackball right away I would have bought it at AMAZON. Your options aren't that great pricewise as far as trackballs go, which makes the Marble Mouse a really good deal, unless you are a power user of photo manipulation software or other specific apps which need many buttons programmed.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000K4LF

Schwartz>>>iMinnesotan>>>jdw6415:::This was a good starter card for watching television through my computer. It worked well with Windows 98, but if you were thinking of using it with any operating system released this century, you'd find yourself out of luck. Initially, with 98, I thought very highly of the TV Wonder. However, upon upgrading to Windows 2000, I had to download extra drivers from ATI which ended up locking up the computer after watching TV for more than a few minutes. After that, I thought XP would handle it a little better. Unfortunately, it was worse. I couldn't find any software support from ATI that would co-exist with Windows XP, and have yet to.In retrospect, I probably should have gone with the TV Wonder VE which is compatible with Windows XP after downloading an updated driver from ATI's site.<<<I've probably invested more than ten hours into getting this thing to work. Windows will always open an Explorer Window on an ATI directory every time you start the OS and you have to use Regedit to put quotes around the multimedia software directory paths. Also, I had it working for several months until I purchased a digital camcorder. Installing the camcorder drivers disabled the TV tuner and no amound of uninstall-reinstall could get it to work again. ATI support has not been any help. "Googleing" the web and newsgroups has revealed that the ATI TV Wonder is a nightmare for many people.<<<I think this is a good product if you plan to use it as intended. those that have incompatible graphics cards will run into serious problems, but otherwise this is a great product that gets the job done.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00001MXYW
Yamaha YSTMS30W 3-Piece Computer Speakers:::B00001OPJ1:::Computers & Accessories:::Adding new speakers to a computer is one of the easiest upgrades to make, and also one of the most dramatic. Going from the pair of chirping speakers that came with your computer to the Yamaha YST-MS30 will prove this beyond a doubt.<p> The YST-MS30 is a powered speaker set (meaning no amplifier is necessary) that comes with two 6-watt satellite speakers and an 18-watt subwoofer. You control the power and volume from the right speaker and adjust overall bass levels from a dial on the subwoofer. The included speaker cables are long enough to allow for terrific stereo separation. We installed our system in less than five minutes after removing it from the box.<p> A set of YST-MS30s won't get you kicked out of your apartment anytime soon, but there's more to a speaker system than raw volume. Most people are more concerned with the way the speaker reproduces sounds, and it is in this area that the YST-MS30 excels. The satellite speakers produce crisp highs and a full midrange with enough volume to keep the subwoofer from drowning it out. At full volume, the speakers exhibit no distortion, and they don't hiss like inferior products. Better speakers do exist, but you'll have a tough time finding them at YST-MS30 prices.<p> Good subwoofers are nearly impossible to come by in this price range, but the one included with the YST-MS30s is a wonderful exception. Too frequently, cheap subwoofers thump with monotonous bass, with no variation to the frequency or volume of the sounds it attempts to reproduce. This subwoofer provides a nice frequency response, albeit through the limited range all subwoofers are capable of responding to. The result is tight-sounding bass with enough capability for variation.<p> That the speakers sound so good is surprising considering their relatively tiny size. The square subwoofer unit measures only about 7 inches on a side but can be parked anywhere--including under a desk. The satellite speakers that sit upon the desk are very small, measuring less than 3 inches high and wide, and about 5 inches deep. It's a compact design that sacrifices nothing in terms of sound quality, making it a perfect match for a computer system.<p> After a few days with these speakers we really missed not having a headphone jack. It's difficult to find desktop computer speakers with headphone jacks in the first place, so this isn't a serious drawback, but it would make a nice addition. What makes these (and most computer speakers) so great is they use a headphone jack for input, meaning they can be attached to a variety of devices, such as personal CD players, televisions with headphone output, and compact cassette recorders. These devices also can serve as a preamp, allowing you to boost the YST-M30s beyond their standard volume levels and add further versatility to a clean-sounding set of speakers. Anyone looking for a three-piece system would do well to consider the YST-MS30.<p> <b>Pros:</b><br> <ul> <li>Crisp, distortion-free sound <li>Small speakers <li>Responsive bass <li>Easy to install </ul> <p> <b>Cons:</b><br> <ul> <li>No headphone jack <li>Could use a little more volume </ul>				    						::::::matt.mingkee>>>akwriter "write4success">>>Craig Fenton "Craig The Airplane Man":::I have this 3-pieces set, cost me 69.99 b4 rebate, once I set up and play on my CD walkman first, yes! this is a good set for the price, deep, no boomy bass, clear mid and treble, but somehow the mid-high sounds a little bit awfulthis set is much better than any 3-peices set I had till I got JVC desktop stereo+Sony woofer, then I gave away, and they says this speaker set sounds very good<<<I used to have a lot of respect for TEAC products, but some years back they took the cheaply-made consumer electronics route and it's been downhill ever since.

The headphone jack has a volume control and the tape deck has pitch control.  If you have ever found a tape sounding too fast or a bit on the slow side, you can adjust the pitch for normal playback.The entire AD500 is under twelve pounds.As always try to use quality tapes such as Maxell or TDK for the cassette portion and please keep the tape heads clean or it circumvents the idea of a nice investment.

TEAC AD500 Integrated CD/Cassette Deck (Discontinued by Manufacturer):::B00001OPJQ:::Home Audio:::TEAC AD-500 CD/CASSETTE COMBINATION WITH REMOTE				    						:::https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41G99KYG98L._SX200_.jpg:::Kevin Arthur Wong "pheriwinkle">>>Snuffy>>>Craig Fenton "Craig The Airplane Man":::Let me start by saying that when I scanned all of my CDs in to iTunes to work with my iPod and iPhone, I deliberated long and hard about the compression rate I would use, and I finally settled on 320-bit AAC with explicit stereo, because I really could tell the difference between various setting after comparing them with carefully chosen songs.  And I do regret a bit not having done Apple Lossless Format now.  By this I'm trying to say I have sensitive ears.I was so looking forward to the TEAC AD-500 to solve all my problems.  (1) I really wanted to be able to control cassettes with a remote control and (2) I wanted a "real" single-disc CD Player that functioned as such, instead of using a DVD player to play CDs, which is slower and inconvenient--the track number is not displayed, the "screen saver" often engages so you have to hit buttons more than once after a time, etc.The first thing I did when I unpacked the TEAC AD-500 was to set it up and attached it to my tuner so that I compare it against my existing equipment.  The cassette player was the most disappointing.  I currently have a Pioneer CT-W606DR, which remains the best sounding cassette player I have ever encountered or read about online (that has a reasonable cost).  I chose two cassettes to compare mainly because I new that the magnetic tape in them was in excellent condition and has great sound quality.  These were "The Dealer" by Chico Hamilton and "Introspective" by the Pet Shop Boys.  I tried both with speakers and with headphones.  The TEAC sounded pretty good, I must admit.  However, when you compare it against my current Pioneer, it paled in comparison.  The Pioneer had far greater treble response, yielding a far more vibrant and crisp sound.  There was also a far greater "depth" with the Pioneer--that feeling that you can reach into the sound to touch the individual instruments.  I should say that I had Dolby noise reduction off on both units.  I mean, the TEAC does sound far better than my two Sony cassette walkmen.  However, the promise of a remote control was not enough for fogive the lesser sound quality.The CD section of the TEAC is less dissapointing.  I was comparing it to a Sony DVD-Recorder RDR-GXD455.  The similarity was much closer here.  However, I have to say that the Sony came out slightly ahead of the TEAC.  The tonal quality of the reproduction was a bit richer and the highs were a bit more crisp.  This might boil down more to a matter of personal preference rather than absolute superiority.So, alas, I'm going to return this unit and limp a long with the functional deficiencies in my current equipment in exchange for better sound quality.<<<Hard to find a cd / cassette deck combination in this day.  Seems to be the best price for the unit.<<<As the author of the Jefferson Airplane book "Take Me To A Circus Tent" and a former radio disc-jockey (That worked in several electronic stores), I am often asked to write and or discuss various audio products and recordings from the 60's and 70's.TEAC W-600R Dual Full-Logic CassetteThe Teac unit gives you the ability to play on both portions of the deck and record on one.  Although you may be tempted to use high speed dubbing, take the extra time and record in the normal mode.  Very few decks (Especially in the price range of 100.00) were able to offer trouble free high-speed dubbing.The old saying you get what you pay for is realistic.  The construction is not made for heavy use on a daily basis and you need to operate the controls with care and not reckless abandon.If you take it easy on the controls and use but don't abuse, for the price you will be satisfied.As always try to use quality tapes such as Maxell or TDK for the cassette portion and please keep the tape heads clean or it circumvents the idea of a nice investment.

Also useful if you want to transfer your cassettes to CDs or DVDs.<<<After owning a Teac tape recorder since 1983 that I was very happy with, I wanted a second one so I purchased this unit. What a dissapointment. It cliked and clanked when the tape engaged. It didn't have a earphone jack--my fault, I should have looked closer. After a couple weeks of use it wouldn't accept the audio feed in order to record so I returned it.<<<Nice controls, a solid chassis, easy to use remote.  The standout feature for me is that the transport is absolutely silent when playing---no hiss or hum from the motors (I mean if you put your ear up to the component itself---not the lack of noise on the audio outputs, which should be a given with any but the cheapest disc player).  The error-correction algorithms are excellent---I played some badly scratched CDs that other players could not handle and could barely hear the data interpolation at the scratch points.  I would give it five stars but for two things--- (1) occasional speaker pop on power-up (easily resolved if you use a delay circuit or just turn your power amp/receiver on last when powering up your system), and (2) limited programming/playback options---there doesn't seem to be any way to set the unit to play just a single CD straight through (without creating a program containing all the tracks of that CD).  The internal DAC is not bad, and of course the optical output lets you hook up your DAC of choice.  Bottom line, this is a GREAT bargain in Red Book changers, well worth searching out used or as a liquidation special since it seems to have been discontinued and not replaced with an improved model (what is JVC thinking?).:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00001OPJV

I have been very pleased with this item and its performance.<<<Many people will tell you that you can't tell one CD player or CD changer from another as far as sound.  Well it seems as though I can and this JVC machine has the best specs in it's price range.  I listen to everything from Rock to Classical and the reproduction of this machine is second to none.  There are more "advanced" CD changers that cost two or even three times as much and yet they don't come close to the sound of this CD changer.I guess I am bad talking about the features of this machine.  So I will leave that up to somebody else.  I will say that you can load three CDs at one time which is more than most CD changers.  I just like it for the meat and potatoes of the basics of sound reproduction.EDIT:  Right now I am a man with two stereos.  I know that I should be so lucky.  This JVC is with my OLD "A" system.  I have owned this model or the 158 just below it a few times before. My last JVC 258 lasted only 9 months before starting to skip uncontrollably.  I have had durability problems with this model even though as I've said it has the best specs in it's class.  When not owning the JVC I've owned a Harmon Kardon which sounded superior, but costed more, and broke after only 3 months.  I've also owned Sony's both the budget, mid, and high-end models and have various problems from not being satified with the sound to not being able to play copies or MP3's.  Currently my "B" system has a Yamaha 697 which has great specs, but is more expensive.  I hope the Yamaha will be more durable.<<<I have had this unit for a little over a year, using it infrequently.

Koss &#39;The Plug&#39; In-Ear Headphones (Black):::B00001P4XA:::Headphones:::The Koss Plug revolutionized the world of in-ear headphones. A first of its kind, these are stereo, noise isolating in-ear headphones that deliver the kind of accurate acoustical reproduction and isolation typically found in high-end, closed-style high fidelity headphones.  A dynamic element positioned just outside the ear connects to a tubular port structure that inserts into a soft, expandable cushion. The soft, foam cushion expands for a custom comfort fit with every listening experience. It also improves isolation, plugging out ambient sounds, and enhances deep bass and treble clarity. 				    						:::https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/616ex7VFftL._SX200_.jpg:::Abbey>>>AJ Runner "ajrunr">>>Alan Duquette:::Beautifully soft and comfortable, cone-shaped earphones, and the only ones I've ever found that don't keep falling out of my ears like earbuds do. Good sound quality, and excellent price, with the superb Koss reputation behind them.<<<Great sound for the price. Plus absolutely amazing sound isolation for traveling! For $10 you get something that paying $100 wouldn't compete with.I've traveled with my friend and his high dollar Bose noise canceling headphones and while those are more comfortable (since the don't sit in the ear) the isolation was just as good.Mine wore out after a little over a year, so I mailed them back to Koss since they have a lifetime warranty, and I got a new pair.Can't beat that.Only downside is that wearing them for hours and hours can cause your ear canals to be a little sore.<<<Warranted for lifetime but 9 dollars return EACH (even if shipped multiples) for shipping plus whatever you pay to ship to them to repair facility.  They can be shipped for 3 dollars or less (no matter how many) very easily so Koss is definitely cheating us here.  Used to be 6 dollars and even then they charged individually for these tiny items but you could gain a little over this 12 dollar for new price.Ear buds themselves are fairly good (usually last me about 2 months) when compared to how long most others last at this price and sound is also pretty good.

The cord gets tangled up half the time.  Also, after some time (1-2 years) the ear cushions become shredded, and must be replaced.June 22, 2012 update.  I have purchased another pair, and I'm very impressed. (New headphones needed since the previous pair would intermittently drop the signal.)  The cord seems shorter, and it is thicker so it only gets a little tangled. Also the ear muffins appear larger.  For the price, I know of nothing that's better.  A great buy.<<<These headphones have been the companion to my laptop since the day I bought them. They are small, light, and deliver surprisingly good sound for the size.On the negative size, the foam ear pads can fall off very easily, and have a relatively short life. The sliders that adjusts the tension in the band move to max tension at the slightest touch.<<<I purchased these headphones looking for a set of sub-100 dollar on-ear phones.

Collins">>>Andy Block>>>Arthur J. Borges Jr. "ajb":::These headphones work well if you want to listen to music but still be able to hear extraneous sounds (like the phone ringing, baby crying, etc.) without difficulty. The problem with them is that the wire is coated with a canvas-like material that, in my case, without extreme use, opened up in several places exposing the wires. Koss does have a lifetime warranty on the product, however it costs one third of the item's price plus shipping to send it back, and it will most likely have the same problem. Don't waste your money, get something else.<<<For the price, heck, for 3 times the price, these sound great to me. If I were to rate these on sound alone I would put them in a class with $120 to $170 headphones. They have great bass, nice high highs and are clear and undistorted in most of the situations in which I use them. I could go on for pages about how much I like the sound and how they sound, to me, like much more expensive headphones. They are open style, which is not in vogue now with people who are discovering high fidelity headphones for use with a portable player, but they are very practical when you want to be able to hear your surroundings.The fit is good. But the headband is awkward. It consists of a pair of tightly curved metal bands that are bound by two plastic slide clips. You push the clips together to extend the bands apart from each other, thereby expanding the space between the earpieces. The system works and feels pretty durable to me, but it is clumsy. Or I am clumsy. Either way it is unusual. But when they are on, they stay in place, and for on-the-ear style headphones, they are quite comfortable to me. They are also very light as they are very thin, not padded (except on the earpieces) and small. These are actually really good on-ear headphones for someone who wants to jump in their headphones.I think their great advantage is their sound quality. They look and feel a little flimsy, but I think they aren't as flimsy as they look. But I don't think anyone is buying these for the look, unless they are doing it ironically. The quality of sound is the star here. I don't think they sound as good as $200 headphones, but that isn't bad, considering the fact they usually sell for around $24.For identical sound (as far as I am concerned) with a simpler and less expensive headband, I suggest the Koss KTXPRO1 at about $18. It is technically a different driver (titanium coated), but I cannot hear a difference and I find the headband easier to deal with.<<<The headphones provide great sound throughout their sound range.  Even though they are not over ear headphones the bass is solid, and always there without downing out midrange or the high notes.  They can be worn for extended periods of time without fatigue, and your ears do not sweat.  I would strongly suggest incurring the additional expense for an in-line volume cotrol to watch movies.  Since your not next to your receiver it makes volume adjustments much easier.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00001P505

The dazzling Spectrum Analyzer Display give the appearance of dancing Christmas lights!  You can just sit and watch the display lights dance across the whole spectrum as you listen to your favorite kind of music!My old Technics unit was good, but it didn't have the display. Just the buttons that light up in red. There are buttons near the bottom on the front panel for power, Tape 2 & 2, Audio/Video, EQ Bypass, EQ Record and Line/Tape. Two small knobs for adjusting the sound level for left & right channels.When the unit is turned on, the power button lights up in green. In the off position, it lights up in red and stays that way until it is pressed again to turn the unit back on.Getting it hooked up was like the major obstacle course! At first there was no audio for about 3 or 4 tries. Then I thought about sending it back until I hooked up the audio cables, and then, the audio worked perfectly!!All in all, I think that it's a great addition to anyone's stereo system!!

The camera allows you to  make a copy of the disk right in the camera so you can share copies of  photos with friends on the spot.The Mpeg movies are a fun little add  on.  I am taking the camera to England in April and I think it will be fun  to capture little movie clips over there.The rechargeable battery seems  to be adequate. I am planning to purchase the more powerful one that  provides longer charge.The video and audio cables provided allow easy  viewing of the photos on the TV set.The only  negatives with the camera  are the difficulty holding the view steady when the zoom is on (but no  other digital camera maker provides a zoom this powerful)  Also, the light  that leaks out of the window at the top of the LCD screen.  This can be  annoying in a dark room.Overall, this camera delivered the features  that I was looking for.<<<I cannot tell you how wonderful this camera is!  You have to have one!

All problems of older digital cameras have  been solved with this lovely piece of technological work...<<<After carefully studying the features, using them inside thestore, and viewing the pictures on one of their display PCs I washappiest with the high resolution photos that the FD-88 produced as well as it's special effect's capability. I also appreciated the lack of legacy adapters and wires. Its use of standard 3.5 floppies is great. You'll be hard pressed to find a computer without a floppy disk now or in the future.I worked up the courage to buy it, I've been using it for several months now, and I have NO regrets. A couple friends have some of the newer Kodak, AGFA, and Olympus models and they're all disappointed with theirs compared to the FD-88. The disk writes pretty fast and you can get usually 10 or 12 highest quality photos per disk.  Movie resolution is good for PC and Web use, but, its 15 sec or 60 sec recording limit can be a little limiting.  END:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00001QEAE

It takes amazing photographs and is easy to handle and work with. The price was very low considering the great quality photos I can take with it. I couldn't be happier and I take it everywhere. The only disadvantage I can find is that the battery that this camera needs to work is very hard to find, and maybe the seller should have specified it with the information regarding the camera. It works with 2  CR2 2 V Batteries.<<<Had I waited, this would have been the one.  I have the Rebel G, and it has been a great camera.  Having worked in larger, non-automatic formats, I really felt kind of like a &quot;cheater&quot; when I got my new Rebel.  One roll of film was all it took to make a convert of me.  I have rarely been disappointed with my photos.  In fact, the only time I have been, I was really stretching my photographic wings, and had I read the manual more carefully, would not have been disappointed had I followed the directions.My sister-in-law bought the Rebel 2000 this spring, and I didn't think they could improve much on the one I have, but they did.  Trying to focus on confusing images, such as framing wildlife with nearby foliage, can be challenging. The 7 point automatic focusing is a real plus in this respect.  I have learned to work without it, but the advantage of the system allows for quicker capture of images without the need to compose and then re-adjust to the frame you want.Because the camera is so well-made, I will probably not need to replace it for another 20 years.  But---if it should somehow meet with an early demise, the improvements in the new Rebel 2000 would be very welcome!<<<The Canon Rebel EOS 2000 is really one of the best buys in 35mm film cameras. The autofocus 28-80 lens works for all but the longest shots, and telephoto lenses are readily available. It's user friendly and takes fantastic photos for the price. It would take a much more expensive camera to make a notable difference in picture quality. I've owned Nikon cameras all of my life(and still do) and love them, but Nikon doesn't really have a comparable camera to the EOS in this price range. This camera is comparable to the old AE1 Program(a great camera also), but with more features and even easier to use. A lot of &quot;Bang For The Buck&quot;!:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00001QEMF

Martin "bowlerholic":::Like many online reviews and even Wikipedia describe this camera, the FM-10 is a entry level film camera. Still, even though it lacks any kind of automation and (more important IMHO) a ground-glass pentaprism viewfinder (extremely important for depth-of-field preview with lenses faster than f/2.8), I believe that this camera is as good as any other SLR film camera. Furthermore, I doubt that any beginner or even more serious amateur photographer who would choose film over digital, has a desire for high automation features in such a camera. The FM-10 (manufactured by Cosina in Japan and sold under the Nikon brand) has a built in light-meter that requires two small batteries (provided with the camera) and is operated by a separate button on the slightly upper left side of the lens. Operating the meter button does require a shift in what would be the most natural and safest left hand grip of the camera, so that holding the camera in a steady position while using the light meter button becomes a bit uncomfortable, but that probably only goes for people with smaller hands like myself. Since most modern light meters suffer from a  biased factory calibration (meaning they would fail the grey card test), I am yet to run some appropriate tests as to check the accuracy of this light meter's calibration. On the positive side (and the right side of the camera), the depth-of-field preview button/lever, although not useful through the entire aperture range as mentioned above, is in a comfortable position and does fulfill its purpose at apertures starting from f/4 up. Although built on a metallic frame, the camera's body is mostly plastic. Personally, I don't think it feels cheap (no squeaky noises during handling) but I do feel like exercising caution at all times when handling it or placing it on hard surfaces, and I will think twice before taking the camera out in the rain, mist or extreme cold weather (I wouldn't care with a 35 yrs. old Nikon F1), rolling in the dirt or sand for nature close ups, etc. The camera case, although not made of quality leather as you might expect from a Nikon camera (but again, this is NOT a Nikon built camera), does provide a reasonable level of protection, except maybe for the top edges of the camera, where the attempt to leave the strap hooks come thru, has left those areas exposed to dust and other possible external damaging factors. It is also a bit awkward to remove and put back on because its edges always rub harshly agains the focus ring of the lens, which in time might create marks or even damage, especially on a plastic built lens like the one that comes with the camera. I would suggest looking for an older (much tougher and better built) leather case. The lens that comes with the camera is rated one of Nikon's worst lenses (check out Ken Rockwell's reviews for more info), but that doesn't mean you cannot take any pictures at all with it. A lens choice is always a matter of personal taste, as well as an educated choice for some users. The day I ordered my FM-10, I have also ordered a Nikkor 50mm f/1.2 manual focus lens, a mechanical and optical masterpiece suitable only for fully manual film Nikon SLRs at an unbeatable price compared to similar lenses built for digital or automated cameras. I have removed the bundled lens without even removing the lens cap and replaced it with the 50mm (much heavier as it is all metal built). For those who are not willing to &#34;waste&#34; $6-700 on a new fixed lens, I would suggest the older Nikkor 70-200mm AIS lens. You probably won't be able to find a new one because they don't make them anymore (as opposed to the 50mm above that you can get brand new), but you should be able to find one online in very good condition, anywhere between $100 and $400 depending on the seller. I got one for $220 in mint condition on eBay. Remember, the lens is the most important part of your camera and the decisive factor in the overall quality of your pictures (apart of course from your aesthetic and artistic feel). It remains to be seen how the not-so-high-quality of this camera will hold over time, but unless you want to go for one of the much older, bulkier (but better built) genuine Nikon SLRs, then the FM-10 is a good choice for the money, even if I consider the lens completely useless (that's just me). The reason why I didn't go for an old Nikon is because I couldn't find one from a reliable source. All sellers claim their old Nikons to be in perfect or good condition, most of them actually being completely unaware of any possible problems. Unfortunately, the slightest mechanical issue in an old Nikon SLR is very hard to detect, even harder to fix or re-calibrate, and ultimately renders the camera unusable (i.e. a slight shift in exposure time). With the money I'd pay for a defective Nikon F1 (rated in good condition) and having it fixed, I'd get a new FM-10, a leather case and some lens filters. Overall, even if I don't feel the same confidence (yet) as I used to with my old Zenit 11, I am happy with my new purchase and will try to get the best of it for as long as I can. I hope this helps you make the right choice for you.<<<I ordered this camera for the sole purpose of using it in my black/white photo class. And so far i have been able to do everything required with this camera. The lens that comes with the camera is a great starter lens. you have the 35mm setting for to take some pretty good wide angle shots, and u can zoom in any where all the way up to 70mm. its a very versatile lens! some people think this is a "beginners" camera and while it is a great camera to learn on, even my photography teacher who has been shooting for over 35 years still owns one of these cameras and loves it. the body is not made out of metal like a lot of earlier nikons, but that doesnt mean this camera wont last you a good 40+ years if treated correctly.but i do however have some concerns.. My first issue was that the lens has a little bit of movement up by the focusing barrel. as in its not 100% tight. im not sure if all lens are like this or if its because this nikkor lens is maybe cheaper quality than other nikon/nikkor lenses. its not really anything big but i decided to exchange it and the next one i got was the same.also for a night photography assignment i had to do, i decided to shoot without a tripod but instead use some 3200iso film. my instructor said that i should be fine with 3200 because its very sensitive to light, hover i found my self only being able to shoot at f3.5 and with a 30/100 shutter speed! and i did set the cameras iso to 3200. dont know if thats normal or not.and finally one thing that was confusing about purchasing this camera on amazon was their very confusing product description that says these camera are "refurbished" yet when you look at the sellers and their listings, all of them are listed as new. my camera appeared to be new but i dont think there is a way to tell for sure.<<<I have an Embroidery Machine that I purchased at the end of 2004. I did a lot of reading before using it and found out that SanDisk brand flash cards were highly recommended to use when storing purchased designs. They are the ONLY brand of compact flash that does not lose any of my designs (I had this happen years ago on a different brand of compact flash).I have bought almost 3,000 designs over the years and I always trust using a SanDisk Compact Flash card over anything else on the market!:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00001QHP5

Carr "flrhcarr">>>+++>>>IslandJanet:::Though this card, 32 megs is minute, you still may only need that. I picked this up (about 4 1/2 years ago), when it was state of the art & about sixty bucks or so. I still have both cards! Well over 4,000 photos & bazillions of files!! Never a read or write error! I've never lost anything with it. Unlike the Lexar!If you're looking into compact flash cards, go with who started it. I have a 128mb sandisk, & am now looking into their 2 gig Ultra card, for my new camera. Because I want speed, & need the space for 8MP photos.The write/capture function is slow, it's not meant for speed. But for swapping & transferring it's faster than from cd (with the right reader/writer)!SD cards & micro drive are inching in, but Sandisk keeps imporoving the CF (they also make SD cards).There are cheaper & less expensive cards out there, but how important is your data/photo? You can't always retrieve your files, with the flash memory programs. I know. I used three of them on my Lexar, & NEVER got all of the images. But that just may be the cards I have, who knows? There isn't any quality control any longer, who cares? Sandisk is the most accurate.<<<Commend added in December 2002: this review was written when 2 megapixel cameras were top of the line, and a 32 MB card costed over a hundred dollars. Now, the prices have dropped so much that the same review would be more applicable to a 128 or 256 MB card. - A.I.Nobody would argue that the more memory you have in your digital camera, the better. The question is what the reasonable compromise between the price of a memory card and its size is, and how to predict how much memory you actually need before you paid for it. I looked up some literature on the image compression techniques, and made some experiments with printing out pictures with different resolution and different compression ratios, and came to the following conclusions.Most cameras offer a choice between several picture resolutions and several image compression modes. Low resolution is good for on-screen viewing, while high resolution is better suited for printouts. It is not uncommon for digital photographers to take pictures at a resolution lower than the maximum allowed by their camera, although there seems to be no point of buying an expensive high-resolution camera to take low-resolution pictures. A probable reason for that is that their camera was shipped with a very small memory card and did not upgrade it yet. Unfortunately, high resolution images require lots of storage space: an uncompressed image taken by a 3 megapixel camera can be as large as 10 MB. JPEG compression, which is based on an algorithm specifically developed for image compressing helps to store large pictures in relatively small files. Specifically, JPEG compression algorithm divides an image into squares 8*8 pixels each, performes two-dimensional discrete cosine trasform of each of these squares, and compresses their frequency spectra by removing the high-frequency components or by decreasing their accuracy through a "quantization" procedure. While this review is not appropriate for a discussion of technical details of the JPEG algorithm, it is worth saying that JPEG analyzes each small "brick" of the image individually and adapts the level of smoothing/compressing to the image to be compressed. In fact, you determine not the size of the compressed image, but the level of its quality: the final size of the compressed file varies depending on each particular image. This "adaptive" nature of JPEG makes it very efficient: it takes advantage of the smoothness of monotonically colored parts of the image by achieving great compression ratios in those areas without significant losses in quality, and it is also good at rendering sharp contrasts in the image. Since JPEG standard was optimized to take into account the specifics of our perception of visual information (like mp3 compression of music files takes advantage of the way how we hear music), JPEG compressed pictures are almost undistinguishable from the originals up to the compression ratios of 1:8 to 1:12.Therefore, a combination of highest possible resolution of your camera with the "fine" (or "best") compression mode is a good choice for a digital photographer. If this combination of resolution and compression is used, a 32 MB memory card would be sufficient for about 36 pictures taken by a 3 megapixel camera, or for about 48 pictures taken by a 2 megapixel camera. This is equivalent to one or two rolls of film, which is not a lot, but usually suffices for a day of occasional shooting. Hence, it seems to me that a 32 MB memory card is a good buy for the most of us.Just the last comment: note that there are two types of memory, flash and SmartMedia. Check you camera manual which one you need. SmartMedia memory cards are slimmer, if I am not mistaken.<<<Needed this for older Raymarine electronics in order to perform software upgrade.

A. Soares>>>M. Edwards>>>Patrick Sherman:::I bought this camera about 5 months ago and was really excited, considering this was my first web-cam.  It has worked reasonably well throughout this time.  The only complaint that I have with this cam is that  when I activate the camera software it deactivates my Internet connection.  Other than that it has been a great camera for not only the advanced user  but also the novice.  The picture quality is not bad and for the price you  really can't ask for much more.  As for the software it was also easy to  install and to use.<<<Setup/installation of the camera wasn't perfectly smooth.  The instructions weren't 100% in line with the choices in Windows 98. Once installed, camera works easily.  Picture is not great, but clear.  The  manual focus is not that meaningful.

The picture is clear and if you set the contrast right, images look great.  The only thing I dislike about the QuickCam is that it's very difficult to set it on a table, on top of the monitor, anywhere without it toppling back or falling sideways.  The round camera comes with a rubber base to put it on.  The round camera has something like a metal hook or screw on the bottom, and the base has a slit on top.  You're supposed to slide the screw back and forth on the slit in order to point it where you want to record, but once you get the angle, the heavy cable pulls the camera back and it goes toppling to the floor.  Very frustrating at the least.  I found myself moving towards where tha camera was finally pointing.Otherwise, the software is pretty easy to use, even though it takes very long to load.  I have Windows ME.  You can record videos of unlimited length.  I've had so much fun with this thing!<<<Even if you just want this camera for casual use with your computer and are flexible about picture quality, you will probably have headaches installing the drivers.  I gave up on their mouse years ago, and I suggest avoiding this product as well.  I got it as a gift, and I found that with respect to camera, software, and overall quality this product is a loser.<<<this camera is incredibly easy to install, it really is just plug and  play. you'll need to have video conf software like netmeeting or cuseeme -  the included software isn't worth installing, and the drivers on win98 cd  are fine. won't work with windows NT unless you've installed a usb hub and  drivers especially for NT4. win2000 seems to function ok with it. rotating  focus wheel is cumbersome if you're trying to focus the camera and aren't  standing right next to it. get the latest drivers from logitech (3com)  online. the image is not crystal clear, so don't expect the same quality as  you get from a digital camera, but if you are looking for cost, your  friends will be able to see you just fine with this one. the mounting stand  is a little wierd, and the camera cable makes it shift back and forth. i  had to tie down the cable so i could position the camera and it wouldn't  move. it's not worth investing in a stand for this one because of the  picture quality.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00001U0AJ

Perkins:::Update:  Durability is not as expected.  After a few months of moderate daily use (MP3 player in my shirt pocket) during my commute to and from work the connection between the wires and the stereo plug is beginning to fail.  Regular body movements will cause a break in the connection and I don't expect these ear-buds to last to the end of the year.  Too bad since they produce nice sound.----------------------------------------------------Had these for a few months before opening the package and trying them on.  First tried to use the buds as they were packed - without the little spongy covers over the buds - and was totally disappointed with a loose fit, weak midrange, scratchy treble, and almost no bass whatsoever.Finally got the brilliant idea of putting the covers on and giving them one last try ... Wha?!?!  Were these the same phones?  The buds fit much better in my ears and I had a totally different experience with great mids, good treble, and very decent bass.These earbuds won't change your life but they'll make your MUNI commute more pleasant by allowing you to block out the miscellaneous grunts and chirps made by your fellow transit commuters.Just remember to use the sponge thingys.<<<I always use ear-bud headphones when walking, for some reason the over-the-ear headphones give me headaches. So I've always also just assumed that I'd never have clear sound. No more! These headphones are wonderful.The range of music I like is very much varied. These sound great for all types, and most surprisingly is their ability to handle resonant bass in some newer songs. I'm really amazed, actually. It's weird having sound that's as good as a nice stereo when you're walking the dog.One setback is that I need to use the foam covers because the plastic buds along fall out of my ears at the slightest tug of the cable. It's a setback for me. Maybe my ears are getting bigger as I get older? This has never been an issue. Regardless, it's a tiny fault for the best, cheapest headphones I've ever bought.<<<I purchased these for sport use, and compared them with a set of Sennheiser earbuds I use at the office. The Sonys are a little more expensive, but they have better sound, more bass response, and fit my ears better. Although I'm a fan of Sennheiser products, in this case the Sony product is superior.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00001W0D4

I bought a pair of Sony MDR-v900, and a pair of Sony MDR-7506 from their pro-line.The v900 sounds fine for non-critical listening, but the 7506 shows much more detail.  If you really wanna hear what's in the mix, the 7506 is the ticket.The v900 does favors for low bit-rate mp3 encoded stuff, and it's pleasant to listen to...with a bit of a bump in the 100-200Hz region, but there's just not enough detail to be able to use for critical projects.I bought more pairs of MDR-7506...that should tell you something.  There has been some talk that Sony may discontinue the 7506...sure hope that doesn't happen.BTW, the consumer MDR-v600 is NOT the same thing as the pro-line MDR-7506.  The v600 sounds much more like the MDR-v900.<<<The Sony V900 Headphones have a printed frequency response of 5-80,000hz and I believe it.  They are very sensitive and require a small amount of power to drive and can be driven to deafening levels.  They have great imaging.  The only thing that is wrong with them is that don't fit my head the way that they were designed and I have to wear them backwards with the right channel in the left ear and the left channel in the right ear.  I can wear them hours on end.I listen to mostly classical music, but right now I have some Lords of Acid on which is dance/electronic.  The response is fairly flat, but because the headphones couple with the ear so well the bass response is almost felt!  My opinion is that the sound of these headphones is fairly neutral.  Someone mentioned the Sony model 7506 which to me has a more forward mid-range.If you can't afford these headphones the Sony DJ MDR-700 seems to be just about the same, but a tad less comfortable.  It has about the same response and sensitivity.But I would recommend this model for long term use and happiness.  The only problem I have had is the ear-cups have worn out and that is because I am in Florida and sometime when coming in from the outside I have gotten the earcups wet and obviously they could only stand up to so much of that.<<<These Headphones have lasted 5 years and now the Cord shield is deteriorating.  These Sony Headphones do sound really good, but would have to make some adjustments with placing them over my ears to get the great sound.These Sony Monitor Headphones are very good for home use which is what I purchased them for.  The music I listen to works well with these nicely; Meditation and Environmental Music files, also Drum Music.Sony has a great line of products, but the Construction of the cords are very poor.  If the cord had greater quality, then these headphones would have another star in my rating.As far as my recomendation is for these, Well, I can't make one since they only would last for five yrs.  I have used them a lot, but have starting using my Sony earbuds more, and even those seem to have poor cord construction.So because of the Very Poor Cord Construction, I would now suggest another brand for Headphones, or Earbuds.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00001W0D5

Nice sound and noise reduction capability... and my friend says the girls them love it too.It got caught in a taxi door and it still keeps on kicking too so that is a plus.<<<I'm going to start with the GOOD: The sound is OK.  Highs and mids are decent while bass lacks a bit.  Construction is really durable, I like how there's no exposed cable other than where it runs to the player.  If you fall asleep with headphones on like the Panasonic RP-HTX7-W1 that have an exposed cable above the earcup you'll likely form a break in the cable from sleeping on it.  Not so with these cans.  Also the cable is nice, thick, and it's coiled.The BAD:  It's almost impossible to listen at an enjoyable volume and be polite.  Even at just 50% volume on my Zune people across the room can hear what I'm listening to.  This is a big reason I don't like these.  If you don't care if you annoy people I guess it's ok.They can get uncomfortable in long listening sessions (like after 45 min or so), sometimes near the end of an album I have to take a break.  The headband or whatever that holds the cups to your ears is just too strong/tight for an adult head.  It's fine for short sessions.I actually had a pair of Panasonic RP-HTX7-W1 before these.  I fell asleep in them too often and the problem I described earlier with the cable happened so I got these to replace them.  I liked the Panasonic RP-HTX7-W1 better than these even though they have that bit of exposed cable by the earcups making them vulnerable to break if you fall asleep in them.  They were about the same price, but they were much more comfortable and sound was better ten-fold.<<<After talking to my brother about how much I love my Sony MDR 7506s and even letting him try them on he told me he wanted a pair just like them but I didn't have the money to order them for him for Christmas my dad went to Best Buy and bought him these DJ V500s. While half the price of the 7506s the V500s are probably the best headphones that you can get for 50$. I won't tell them this but I think that the 7506s,V6s and even the Sony V600s sound better than these and are more durable. However since he loves them and they're cheap it seems like a good deal for him but after reading how easily these DJ headphones break I really don't think these are worth replacing with the same model once every year especially when the 7506s sound at least twice as good and can last several years longer.If the V500s break every year I may just have to convince my parents to buy him the same model of headphones I own(which I saved up for and bought with my own money).:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00001W0DG
Sony MDR-V700DJ DJ-Style Monitor Series Headphones (Old Version):::B00001W0DH:::Studio Recording Equipment:::Feel the power of the MDR-V700DJ Studio Monitor Series DJ headphones. Featuring swivel earcups for DJ and remix applications, reversible earcups for added flexibility and an auto return mechanism.				    						:::https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41VNHW671PL._SX200_.jpg:::Andrew Hamada>>>Angelfalls>>>at49:::Anyone looking to purchase these headphones should note: they were designed and advertised for DJ use specifically.  And by DJ, I mean the live-performance variety, not the studio-technician variety.And, for DJs, these headphones are excellent.The actual physical configuration of the headphones is clearly designed for DJ use, with easily folding, individually rotating cups for single-side monitoring.  They are also designed to rest close to the ear which, although it may make your ears hot and uncomfortable if you use them for prolonged home listening, is ideal for DJs because they effectively cancel noise up to extremely high volumes (I've used these in both a small party and club setting, and have found the non-electronic cancellation to be more than adequate for both).The actual sound styling is typical of Sony, with the quality generally reflecting the price.  I listen to a variety of music through these: in addition to hip hop &amp; house for club use, i listen to various other electronica, various rock, lots of acoustic music and a ton of a capella.  The headphones perform admirably in all cases.  The bass is strong without being overbearing, the mids are balanced and the highs are clear without being ringy or piercing.Please note my initial admonition again, however: these headphones are designed for DJs.  For your money, you can probably find a better set for home use by Sennheiser, or similar, which aren't geared torward performance/studio use.  In addition, other reviewers are right: the headphones get uncomfortable after prolonged use (I found that after about 30 minutes to an hour of home use, I felt the need to take them off and massage my ears for a bit, as these fit tight and are a bit heavy).  The only reason I would ever recommend against these for DJs is if you plan on spinning for an extraordinarily extended period of time, because they are slightly heavier than the v600s and the extra weight, while usually unnoticable, can become an issue if you're spinning upwards of five or six hours.<<<I'm an International DJ doing Trance, Rave, D&B, Ambient, and Dubstep. I've owned these headphones for 8 years and they truly NEVER fail me. No matter how hard the bass drop, No matter how long a Trance chorus, They've never popped a speaker and never quit. If you're a REAL DJ and you need a headphone that will last you past a decade then get a pair of these. Armin Van Buuren doesn't use them for no reason, and other Professional DJ's know where its at; Sony MDR-V700's.<<<This is a professional DJ headphone that is seen on numerous DJs, even after having been taken out of commission from Sony (update model is the Sony MDR-V55/BR). The ear cups can be comfortably moved around on your ears as well as worn in a way that lets you listen in on one piece while hearing the output on external speakers. They can also be folded in for easy traveling and are light for their size. As for the sound, hip-hop and house music sounds great although I wouldn't use these for jazz or classical. And although these cans were not introduced as noise-cancelling headphones, they do a very good job at it anyway. I've used them while traveling on flights as well as on subways and almost never hear outside noise. Plus, they achieve this without making your ears feel uncomfortable. Overall, great product for recording/mixing or general listening purposes.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00001W0DH

There is a bit of wear and tear and I take good care of my things.  They were with me on many outings including packing them accross europe and they have held up.  the thin black stuff has peeled off a bit, but it does not affect sound quality or comfort.so lets see, 7 years at $70.  At $10 a year, I am very happy with this purchase.EDIT (6/14/11):I still have these though I don't use them very often. Too bulky and the cord is very long. They still sound great though after all these, wow 13+ years! These things are as old as my cat who is now on prescription food for his feline diabetes. In other words, they have held up better than a slightly neglected pet.<<<Incredible headphones. I'm not an expert on sound like some of the other reviewers, but I love to listen to music. My office can get a bit noisy at times and these headphones do the trick.After a full 8 hours my ears are a little tired from the headphones sitting on them, but I usually don't wear them all day. The ear covers are soft and made from a very comfortable material. The sound is amazing! I think I can hear more music through these headphones than I do my stereo system at home.Cable has two adapters to fit most sized jacks. It is long enough to plug into my PC and still give me room to work comfortably and move around from phone to filing cabinet and back to PC with no troubles.Great buy, I am really impressed with these headphones. Highly recommended.<<<Wonderful wearing this headphone for long period of time ( I used it for more than two hrs most of the time).  Clear and has great bass when turned up volume.  Highly recommend this item.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00001W0DI

Croft>>>Adam Lasnik "Frim Fram Sauce Extraordinaire":::Idk it the faults i find are just because its supposed to be a certain way but these headphones dont make me bob my head and feel the music when im listening to it. Buts its probably because it doesnt have that warmth a lot of people mention about. It picks up every single freakin detail though like the reverb from Tupac's song (Who do u believe in) i've never heard such clarity like that in any headphones ive had, even from the KOSS portapro, which are also freakin amazing. The bass in this isnt outstanding either but its probably intended to be like that so all of the things i knock it off for is probably because they're not intented to be that way. So in conclusion, these head phones, to me arent really my option to listen to tunes but are mainly for recording, which is why i bought them. So =DOh yeah and its a bit sensitive in my headphone jack on my Macbook pro, a little staticy sound, very very faint, is noticeable when u move the jack.<<<After not many hours of use, the entire ear pad on one side became detached from the plastic base plate. The synthetic leather covering was either press fitted or glued over the edge of this plastic part. It looked like I probably could have stretched the thing back over the plastic lip, although it would have taken some time. But because it would certainly have happened again with normal use anyway, I ended up throwing the whole thing away. What a waste. Overall, a very poor design in my view.<<<Perhaps my ears have been sullied by 'augmented' headphones in the past, but these particularly 'phones feel flatter and more lifeless than any others.  I'm not talking about a lack of thumping bass... that's fine by me.  But rather... well, it's hard to describe.  No warmth.  No resonance.  Just sterile.I suppose this'd be fine or perhaps even desireable for studio monitor work, but when I'm trying to enjoy folk tunes, classic jazz, orchestral music... it's just disheartening.:::https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00001WRSJ
